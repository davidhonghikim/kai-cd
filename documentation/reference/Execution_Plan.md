# Documentation Migration Execution Plan

## Project Overview
**Mission**: Migrate 476 markdown files from `documentation/brainstorm/kOS/` to the structured documentation system, ensuring ALL low-level implementation details are preserved and enhanced with comprehensive TypeScript implementations.

**Critical User Mandate**: "we need all the low level details! this is the source of truth for all different agents and people to work on at various times. we need everyone aligned no matter what and not creating their own processes"
