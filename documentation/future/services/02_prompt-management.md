# Prompt Management System

> **Agent Context**: Centralized prompt management system for kOS with templates and cross-agent sharing  
> **Implementation**: ðŸŽ¯ Future vision - Intelligent prompt management for entire agent ecosystem  
> **Use When**: Managing AI prompts, implementing templates, planning prompt systems

## Quick Summary
Centralized prompt management system for kOS providing secure, intelligent management of AI prompts with templating, dynamic injection, version control, performance tracking, and cross-agent sharing capabilities.

## Overview

The kOS Prompt Management System (PromptKind) provides centralized, secure, and intelligent management of AI prompts across the entire agent ecosystem. It enables prompt templating, dynamic injection, version control, performance tracking, and secure sharing between agents and users.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

The prompt management system consists of four main components:

1. **Prompt Library**: Centralized storage and organization of prompt templates
2. **Template Engine**: Dynamic prompt resolution and variable substitution
3. **Execution Engine**: Secure prompt execution with model selection
4. **Analytics Engine**: Performance tracking and optimization

### Prompt Template Format

Templates use a structured format with metadata, variables, and execution requirements:

```yaml
# Example: System prompt template
id: "system.agent.assistant"
name: "Agent Assistant System Prompt"
type: "system"
category: ["agent", "assistant"]
tags: ["helpful", "harmless", "honest"]

template: |
  You are {{agent_name}}, a helpful AI assistant with the following characteristics:
  
  Personality: {{personality_traits}}
  Expertise: {{domain_expertise}}
  Constraints: {{safety_constraints}}
  
  Your role is to assist users with {{primary_capabilities}} while maintaining:
  - Helpfulness: Always try to provide useful information
  - Harmlessness: Avoid harmful or dangerous suggestions
  - Honesty: Be truthful about limitations and uncertainties

variables:
  - name: "agent_name"
    type: "string"
    required: true
    description: "Name of the agent"
  - name: "personality_traits"
    type: "array"
    required: true
    description: "List of personality characteristics"
  - name: "domain_expertise"
    type: "array"
    required: true
    description: "Areas of expertise"

modelRequirements:
  minContextLength: 4096
  supportedModalities: ["text"]
  recommendedModels: ["gpt-4", "claude-3", "llama-3"]

permissions:
  visibility: "public"
  editPermissions: ["admin", "prompt_manager"]
  usePermissions: ["all_agents"]

securityLevel: "standard"
```

## Prompt Types and Categories

- `{{#if condition}}...{{/if}}` - Conditional content
- `{{#each array}}...{{/each}}` - Iteration over arrays
- `{{variable_name | filter}}` - Value transformation

### Security Validation
All templates undergo security validation:
