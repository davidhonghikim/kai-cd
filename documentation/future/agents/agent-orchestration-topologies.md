# Agent Orchestration Topologies & Scaling Patterns

## Agent Context
This document defines comprehensive topological layouts for orchestrating and scaling kAI agents across different environments and operational modes. Critical for agents implementing distributed coordination, load balancing, and adaptive scaling strategies. Provides architectural patterns for local, edge, distributed, and cloud deployments.

## Overview

Agent orchestration topologies define how kAI agents are organized, deployed, and coordinated across different environments. These patterns enable optimal resource utilization, fault tolerance, and scalability while maintaining security and performance requirements.

### Topology Classification Framework
```typescript
interface TopologyClassification {
  environmentTypes: {
    local: "Single-device deployment with full-stack on one system";
    edge: "Multi-device LAN coordination with local mesh networking";
    distributed: "Peer-to-peer coordination across geographic locations";
    cloud: "Cloud-native deployment with elastic scaling";
    hybrid: "Mixed local/cloud deployment with intelligent offloading";
  };
  
  operationalModes: {
    autonomous: "Self-governing agents with minimal supervision";
    supervised: "Human or system oversight with intervention capabilities";
