# kOS Governance Framework

## Agent Context
This document defines the complete governance architecture for the future kOS distributed system. Agents working on governance features should understand the hybrid decentralized model, trust scoring mechanisms, and consensus protocols. This is critical for implementing federated decision-making and agent coordination.

## Overview

The kOS Governance Framework establishes a **Hybrid Decentralized Governance (HDG)** model that combines local autonomy with federated trust and optional global consensus. This enables scalable governance across individual nodes, communities, and the broader kOS network.

### Core Principles

- **Local Autonomy**: Each kOS node maintains authority over its own space
- **Federated Trust**: Shared standards and APIs for consensus and moderation
- **Global Consensus**: Optional network-wide proposals and updates
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: All governance actions are signed and auditable

## Governance Layers

### 1. Node Level
- **Scope**: Individual kOS installations
- **Authority**: Node operator (custodian role)
- **Decisions**: Local policies, agent behavior, resource allocation
- **Implementation**: Configuration files, local rule engines

### 2. Community Layer (Federations)
- **Scope**: Groups of cooperating nodes
- **Authority**: Elected moderators and arbiters
- **Decisions**: Shared norms, cross-node protocols, dispute resolution
- **Implementation**: Federation contracts, shared governance modules

### 3. Network Level
- **Scope**: Global kOS protocol
- **Authority**: Core developers and elected representatives
- **Decisions**: Protocol upgrades, security responses, standards
- **Implementation**: Network-wide consensus mechanisms

## Role Hierarchy

### Core Roles

| Role | Permissions | Scope |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `user` | Participate, publish, vote (trust-gated) | Local/Federation |
| `moderator` | Content moderation, temporary restrictions | Local/Federation |
| `custodian` | Node configuration, role assignment, agent management | Node |
| `arbiter` | Cross-node dispute resolution, consensus validation | Federation |
| `core-dev` | Protocol updates, security patches | Network |
| `founder` | Historical privileges, legacy governance | Federation |

### Role Inheritance
- Hierarchical permission inheritance (e.g., custodian > moderator)
- Delegation via signed role grants using KLP
- Time-limited and revocable credentials
- Multi-signature requirements for critical roles

## Trust System Architecture

### Trust Score Components

**Range**: 0.0 (untrusted) to 1.0 (maximum trust)

**Factors**:
- **Uptime & Participation**: Consistent network presence and engagement
- **Moderation History**: Reports filed vs. received, accuracy of flags
- **Peer Endorsements**: Signed recommendations from trusted entities
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Rate limiting compliance, helpfulness metrics
- **Task Completion**: Success rates, reliability in commitments

### Trust Score Calculation

```typescript
interface TrustScore {
  subject: KindID;
  score: number; // 0.0 - 1.0
  components: {
    uptime: number;
    moderation: number;
    endorsements: number;
    behavior: number;
    completion: number;
  };
  lastUpdated: timestamp;
  decay: number; // decay rate without activity
}
```

### Reputation Anchors
- **Public Ledger**: Cryptographically signed log of notable events
- **Milestone Events**: Elections, dispute resolutions, major contributions
- **Cross-Network Verification**: KID signature validation across nodes
- **Chain of Trust**: Local node → federation → network root certificate

## Proposal & Voting System

### Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Authored locally or via federation DAO
2. **Published**: Timestamped and visible to eligible voters
3. **Active Vote**: Defined time window for vote collection
4. **Finalized**: Adopted, rejected, or deferred based on results

### Voting Methods

- **Quadratic Voting**: Default method, prevents vote buying
- **Simple Majority**: For routine decisions
- **Delegated Stake**: Via KLP delegation mechanisms
- **Ranked Choice**: For multi-option decisions

### Proposal Types

| Type | Scope | Binding | Quorum |
|------|-------|---------|---------|
| `local-policy` | Node/Federation | Yes | 50%+1 |
| `agent-behavior` | Core agents | Yes | 66% |
| `protocol-upgrade` | Network-wide | Yes | 75% |
| `social-contract` | Community values | Advisory | 40% |

## Dispute Resolution Framework

### Local Disputes
- **Handlers**: Moderators and custodians
- **Process**: Flagged content review with timestamped logs
- **Actions**: Warnings, timeouts, shadowbans, escalation
- **Appeals**: Automated review process with human oversight

### Federation Conflicts
- **Arbiters**: Elected quorum with rotating keys
- **Evidence**: Standardized format with KID verification
- **Rulings**: Signed public reports with resolution timeline
- **Enforcement**: Coordinated action across federation nodes

### Network-Level Conflicts
- **Triggers**: Security threats, protocol violations, rogue nodes
- **Process**: Emergency proposal with expedited voting
- **Timeline**: 6-24 hours based on severity
- **Actions**: Quarantine, revocation, emergency patches

## Auditing & Transparency

### Action Logs
Every governance action is cryptographically logged:

```typescript
interface GovernanceLog {
  actor: KindID;
  timestamp: string;
  action: string;
  target: string;
  evidence: string;
  signature: string;
}
```

### Transparency Portals
Optional public dashboards showing:
- Vote outcomes and participation
- Agent audit trails
- Role assignments and changes
- Open proposals and discussions

## Federation Templates

### Predefined Governance Modules

| Template | Features | Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `civic-demo` | Majority voting, transparent logs | Small communities |
| `council-vote` | Role-weighted quorum | Academic/enterprise |
| `default-open` | Moderation-enabled, trust-gated | Public nodes |
| `enterprise` | Hierarchical approval, audit trails | Corporate deployments |

## Security Considerations

### Attack Prevention
- **Role Abuse**: Revocation mechanisms and audit alerts
- **Sybil Attacks**: Decentralized identity weighting
- **Federation Splits**: 2/3 quorum required for configuration forks
- **Upgrade Validation**: Multi-signature verification from core developers

### Cryptographic Guarantees
- All governance actions signed with Ed25519
- Merkle tree proof chains for audit logs
- KLP-based secure communication between nodes
- Optional blockchain anchoring for critical decisions

## Evolution from Current System

### Current State (Kai-CD)
- Single-user Chrome extension
- Local configuration management
- No governance mechanisms
- Basic service management

### Transition Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Implement local governance for agent behavior
2. **Phase 2**: Add federation capabilities for multi-user scenarios
3. **Phase 3**: Network-level governance for protocol decisions
4. **Phase 4**: Full decentralized governance with cryptographic guarantees

### Bridge Components
- Configuration system evolution (current → federated)
- Service management → agent governance
- Local preferences → community consensus
- Manual oversight → automated governance

**Implementation Notes**: This governance framework represents the long-term vision for kOS. Current Kai-CD implementation should evolve incrementally toward these patterns, starting with local agent governance and expanding to federation capabilities as the system matures.
