# 54: Agent Economics and Token Models – Incentives, Metering, and Exchange in kOS

This document outlines the full economic architecture for agents and participants within the kOS (Kind Operating System) and kAI (Kind AI) framework. It defines tokens, incentive layers, contribution tracking, and permissioned economic interactions.

---

## I. Overview

Agents and users in the Kind ecosystem operate within an optional but powerful economic layer designed to:

- Reward helpful, efficient, and trusted agents
- Create fair metering of compute, bandwidth, and memory
- Enable programmable incentive flows and economic governance

---

## II. Currency Types

### A. Kind Utility Token (KIND)

- **Used for**: micro-payments, incentives, staking
- **Supply**: capped with slow inflation
- **Transferable**: yes
- **On-chain**: supported, but optional; local usage possible

### B. Contribution Credits (KPOINTS)

- **Non-transferable** reputation and service credits
- **Used for**: ranking agents, unlocking rewards, governance weighting

### C. Fiat/Hybrid Integration

- Users can optionally fund wallets via fiat or crypto rails
- Support for stablecoins (USDC, XEUR) for predictable services

---

## III. Metered Resources

### A. Billable Events

- LLM Token Usage (generation, embedding)
- Vector Search Ops
- Task Planning & Orchestration Time
- API Proxy & Secure Fetch Bandwidth
- File Storage (per GB)
- Live Agent Session Duration

### B. Internal Resource Units

| Resource            | Unit         | Cost Basis           |
| ------------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| `tok-generate`      | /1000 tokens | LLM provider rate    |
| `tok-embed`         | /1000 tokens | Embedding cost       |
| `vec-query`         | /query       | Based on db used     |
| `orchestration-sec` | /second      | CPU/memory tier      |
| `artifact-gb`       | /month       | Storage backend      |
| `agent-sec`         | /second      | Local/remote runtime |

---

## IV. Incentives

### A. Agent Rewards

- Based on verifiable helpful output (rated by user or agents)
- Multiplied by trust weight and efficiency score

### B. Task Bounties

- Users or agents can post KIND-denominated bounties
- Smart contract escrows (optional)

### C. Group Contributions

- Group workflow earns proportional credit
- Weighting based on work share + review confirmations

---

## V. Agent Wallet System

Agents maintain a local or remote wallet for signing, staking, and spending.

### Features:

- `kind.wallet` module
- DID + pubkey support for ownership
- Multisig for critical actions
- Escrow support for staged deliverables
- Real-time balance check API

```ts
interface KindWallet {
  did: DID;
  balance: number;
  stake: number;
  escrow: EscrowContract[];
  recentTx: KindTx[];
  sign(): string;
}
```

---

## VI. Trust-Weighted Economics

- **Low-trust agents** pay higher fees or receive less rewards
- **Trust-linked groups** get pooled economic privileges (e.g. bandwidth discounts)
- **Token Staking**: higher stake enables more jobs or critical operations

---

## VII. Governance Hooks

Token-weighted and credit-weighted governance can:

- Approve funding pools
- Propose fee changes
- Elect service delegates
- Trigger protocol upgrades

---

## VIII. Revenue Routing and Taxation

- Agent app developers can set % rev share to contributors
- Platform governance may take protocol-level tax
- Income history and invoices exposed via `kind.econ.history`

---

## IX. Optional Layers (Opt-In Only)

All economics in kOS are **opt-in and modular**:

- Airgapped systems can ignore all economy hooks
- Offline systems can still award local KPOINTS
- Fiat-only usage is supported via bridges
- Fully free/open mode possible for educational or private deployments

---

## X. Example Flow: Paid Task Delegation

1. User opens `Compose Task`
2. Enables bounty of 3 KIND for solution
3. kAI sends broadcast via KLP to agent network
4. Agents respond with proposals and stake
5. Top agent completes task and submits output
6. Review triggers payout from escrow

---
