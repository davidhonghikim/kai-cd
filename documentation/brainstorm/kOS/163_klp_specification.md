# 163: Kind Link Protocol (klp) Specification

This document defines the Kind Link Protocol (klp), the unified communication and interoperability layer for agents, services, devices, and nodes operating under the kAI (Kind AI) and kOS (Kind OS) architecture.

---

## I. Overview

`klp` enables distributed, privacy-respecting, agent-to-agent (A2A) and system-to-system (S2S) communication with cryptographic identity guarantees, capability negotiation, and trust scoring built-in.

---

## II. Protocol Objectives

- Provide a **decentralized messaging standard** for AI, humans, and devices.
- Support **cross-domain interoperability** (e.g., local → mesh → cloud → enterprise).
- Enable **dynamic trust negotiation** and **policy-based access control**.
- Define an **extensible payload envelope** for arbitrary service types.

---

## III. Core Protocol Stack

### A. Transport

- Default: WebSockets (wss\://)
- Fallback: HTTPS (polling)
- Optional:
  - NATS
  - LoRa / Reticulum Mesh
  - MQTT over TLS

### B. Message Format

```json
{
  "klp_version": "1.0.0",
  "id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "sender": "agent_id@domain",
  "recipient": "agent_id@domain",
  "capability": "chat|command|data|sensor|event|trust|intent",
  "payload": { ... },
  "signature": "base64-ed25519",
  "trust_score": 0.98
}
```

### C. Cryptographic Identity

- Format: `ed25519` keypairs (identity + signing)
- Address: `base64(pubkey)@domain`
- Storage: Local Vault, KOS Federation, or Hardware Token

---

## IV. Capabilities

| Capability | Description                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `chat`     | LLM or human chat exchange                      |
| `command`  | RPC-style action requests                       |
| `data`     | Raw structured/unstructured data exchange       |
| `sensor`   | Time-series, telemetry, or real-time input      |
| `event`    | Event broadcasting and reactive triggers        |
| `trust`    | Identity validation and score negotiation       |
| `intent`   | High-level goals, plans, or workflow invocation |

---

## V. Trust Score System

### A. Computation Factors

- History of successful interactions
- Cryptographic verification
- Endorsements from known/trusted peers
- Alignment with agent or system policies
- Behavioral metrics (timeliness, consistency)

### B. Trust Score Types

- `local` – Calculated by receiver using internal policy
- `global` – Federated trust network (optional KOS sync)
- `session` – Ephemeral trust for specific interactions

---

## VI. Topologies

### A. P2P (Mesh)

- Ideal for local agent networks and offline mode
- Uses Reticulum for low-bandwidth, high-resilience routing

### B. Federated

- DNS-based routing with decentralized trust authorities
- kOS core node maintains partially synced trust ledger

### C. Hybrid

- P2P within trust groups, federated for external negotiation

---

## VII. Reference Implementations

- `klp-js` (browser + Node.js)
- `klp-py` (FastAPI, Langchain integration)
- `klp-go` (for mobile agents and edge devices)

---

## VIII. Extensibility

- Protocol versioning via `klp_version`
- Capabilities can define their own `payload` schemas
- Custom capability handlers via plugin architecture
- Fallback wrappers for legacy REST/RPC support

---

## IX. Example Use Case: Secure Command Execution

1. `agent-A` sends `command` to `agent-B` to execute a task
2. `agent-B` verifies `agent-A` signature + trust score
3. Executes and responds with signed `event` payload

```json
{
  "capability": "command",
  "payload": {
    "task": "process_document",
    "document_id": "abc-123",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  "trust_score": 0.91
}
```

---

## X. Governance

- Version proposals via KOS-Improvement-Proposal (KIP)
- Open-source protocol core
- Federated authority approval via kOS governance agent
