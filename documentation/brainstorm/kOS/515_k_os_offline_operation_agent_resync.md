# kOS Offline Operation & Agent Resynchronization

## Overview
This document details the protocols and systems that allow agents within the Kind Operating System (kOS) to operate autonomously while disconnected from the broader swarm and to safely resynchronize once connectivity is restored. Offline resilience is critical to support edge scenarios, infrastructure disruptions, and air-gapped operations.

---

## Core Goals
- Enable agents to function autonomously when offline or air-gapped
- Preserve task continuity and data integrity during isolation
- Securely rejoin the swarm without corrupting shared state or history
- Protect against divergent behavior, data poisoning, or sync-time exploits

---

## 1. Offline Operation Modes
### üîã Autonomous Continuity Mode (ACM)
- Agent retains local mission logic and execution queue
- Local cache and sandbox logging remain active
- Behavior restricted to safe, predefined bounds

### üß† Degraded Awareness Mode (DAM)
- For nodes with partial connectivity (e.g. mesh edge)
- Syncs with available peers, logs unresolved operations
- Suspends quorum-critical actions

---

## 2. Resynchronization Protocol
### üõ∞Ô∏è Reconnect Detection
- Periodic beacon broadcasts + passive listening
- Mesh fingerprints or swarm ID handshake

### üì¶ State Snapshot Submission
- Agent packages:
  - Encrypted action logs
  - State deltas
  - Observed swarm signals
- Signs with offline operation signature key

### ü§ñ Swarm Validation Steps
- Consensus check against quorum logs
- Conflict detection and merge queue
- Guardian agent or quorum verifier applies reconciled state

---

## 3. Safeguards Against Desynchronization
- **Time Drift Check**: Synchronize with swarm-approved clock
- **Behavioral Fingerprinting**: Compare offline agent behavior to known norms
- **Command Replay Guard**: Prevents duplicate or expired action execution

---

## 4. Use Cases
- Mountain sensor node logs data for 14 days, rejoins via drone relay
- Field agent in disaster zone operates in ACM, resyncs when uplink restored
- Isolated lab environment runs AI tasks with air-gap integrity guarantees

---

## Future Additions
- Zero-knowledge state merge for privacy-preserving resyncs
- Multi-agent cross-validation protocol for disputed actions
- Quantum-hardened sync tokens for high-security ops
