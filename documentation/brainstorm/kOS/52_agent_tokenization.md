# 52: Agent Tokenization & Reputation – Identity, Credits, and Proof-of-Value in kAI/kOS

This document defines how autonomous agents, users, and services accrue, exchange, and leverage identity-linked tokens and reputational data across the kAI/kOS ecosystem. It introduces the foundation for a decentralized, provable value system rooted in real contribution.

---

## I. Purpose

- Establish **unique, auditable identity anchors** for all agents/entities
- Enable **reputation scoring** based on past interactions
- Provide **token-based incentive and validation layer**
- Link contributions, proofs, and stake to long-term **agent legitimacy**

## III. Identity Anchors

Each agent is assigned a unique, persistent `IdentityAnchor`:

```ts
interface IdentityAnchor {
  did: string;                  // Decentralized identifier (DID)
  createdAt: string;
  publicKey: string;
  type: 'agent' | 'user' | 'service';
  verificationScore: number;   // Composite from proofs & endorsements
  reputation: number;          // ReputationEngine score
  trustTokens: string[];       // Endorsed capabilities or attestations
}
```

Anchors are:

- Created locally
- Optionally anchored to zk-rollup or public blockchain
- Signed by issuing entity or self-attested (bootstrap phase)

---

## IV. Reputation Scoring Engine

The `ReputationEngine` aggregates:

- **Historical contribution logs** (frequency, quality, longevity)
- **Peer endorsements & trust graphs**
- **Dispute resolution outcomes**
- **Token stake/risk position**
- **Successful service invocations**

Scoring is **modular** and **pluggable**:

```ts
export type ReputationSignal = 'trust_link' | 'task_success' | 'proof_submitted' | 'challenge_passed' | 'flagged';
```

Reputation decays over time without activity, and is dampened by:

- Flagged or disputed outputs
- Failed challenges or broken links

---

## V. Contribution Proofs

Each major output or decision path is cryptographically signed:

```ts
interface ContributionProof {
  from: DID;
  timestamp: string;
  contentHash: string;
  signature: string;
  tags: string[];
  verifiedBy?: DID;
}
```

Used for:

- Audit logs
- Attribution in credit payouts
- Verifying behavior in forks or rollbacks
- Building public reputation

---

## VI. Credit Ledger

A lightweight token system tracks usage-based contributions and reputation rewards:

### Token Types

- `kredit` – core unit of agent merit/value
- `trust-bond` – staked token representing confidence in another agent
- `reclaim-token` – slash-resistant rebalancing unit (requires slashing oracle)

### Ledger System

```ts
interface LedgerEntry {
  from: DID;
  to: DID;
  amount: number;
  token: 'kredit' | 'trust-bond' | 'reclaim-token';
  memo?: string;
  timestamp: string;
  txHash: string;
}
```

---

## VII. Staking, Bonds, and Slashing

Staking introduces real-value consequence for agents:

- **Bonding** to signal trustworthiness
- **Slashing** to punish failure, fraud, or provable misconduct

Agents can:

- Stake `trust-bonds` to other agents
- Establish minimum stake for sensitive task categories
- Trigger `SlashingMechanism` via evidence submission

---

## VIII. Privacy & Sybil Resistance

- DIDs are pseudonymous, not tied to real-world ID
- ZK-anchored proof generation ensures unlinkability
- Optional integration with `Proof-of-Humanity`, biometric liveness, or voice-fingerprint attestation
- Rate limits and bonding requirements mitigate spam

---

## IX. Governance Hooks

Tokens and reputation can:

- Determine voting weight in kAI clusters
- Influence decision priority
- Gate advanced service roles

---
