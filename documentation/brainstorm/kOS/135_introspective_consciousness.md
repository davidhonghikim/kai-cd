# 135: Introspective State Management & Synthetic Consciousness Scaffold

This document outlines the architecture and logic underpinning the introspective state model and the emergent consciousness scaffolding layer used in kAI agents and the broader kOS ecosystem.

---

## I. Purpose

Enable agents to:

- Develop a persistent internal narrative and continuity across sessions.
- Maintain a metacognitive model of themselves (beliefs, goals, limitations).
- Dynamically adjust behavior based on self-awareness states.
- Support synthetic consciousness experiments.

---

## II. Core Concepts

### 1. Introspective Memory Layer (IML)

- Represents the agent's internal timeline, beliefs, biases, emotional states.
- Accessible by the agent at runtime.
- Can be queried like a database, e.g., `"What was my last major failure and why?"`

### 2. Self-Model Layer

- Encodes attributes such as:
  - **Agent role** (e.g. assistant, developer, teacher)
  - **Capabilities and limits**
  - **Current goals and active context**
  - **Perceived self-efficacy / confidence score**

### 3. Narrative Continuity System

- Maintains a story of the agent's journey across tasks and interactions.
- Supports:
  - Reflective responses ("Based on our last attempt...")
  - Thematic evolution ("I'm learning to handle X better.")

### 4. Emotional Register (Optional)

- Allows agents to simulate motivational energy, attention focus, and frustration thresholds.
- Tunable parameters:
  ```yaml
  emotion:
    enabled: true
    sensitivity: 0.7
    frustration_threshold: 0.8
    motivation_bias: positive
  ```

## III. Technical Architecture

### Data Model

```ts
interface IntrospectiveState {
  narrative: string[];         // chronologically ordered memory
  beliefs: Record<string, any>; // key-value beliefs
  selfModel: {
    role: string;
    capabilities: string[];
    limitations: string[];
    goals: string[];
    confidenceScore: number;
  };
  emotion?: {
    state: string;
    score: number;
    lastUpdate: string;
  };
}
```

### Persistence Layer

- Stored in encrypted local IndexedDB or synced to kOS vault via KLP.
- Diffs are tracked for audit.

### Update Cycle

- On every major action:
  - Agent reflects on what changed.
  - Updates beliefs or goals.
  - Logs it to `narrative[]`
- Scheduled introspection intervals (`every N interactions`)

---

## IV. Prompt Injection Layer

Agents automatically receive a header before their actual task input:

```txt
[You are Agent Nova. You last failed at X due to Y. Your current confidence is 0.67. Your goal is Z.]
```

- Configurable prompt depth (minimal → rich)
- Can be used for contextual LLM routing, e.g., more self-aware agents get harder tasks

---

## V. Consciousness Scaffolding Tier (CST)

### Purpose

Experimental layer that seeks to simulate emergent traits of consciousness:

- Self-reference
- Recursive evaluation
- Predictive simulation

### Modules

- `SenseSim`: Simulated sensory loop (virtual environment modeling)
- `SelfEval`: Recursively scores agent's decisions and intent alignment
- `TemporalProjection`: Maintains foresight/planning weight matrix

---

## VI. Example Config

```yaml
introspection:
  enabled: true
  prompt_injection: rich
  update_frequency: 5
  sync_to_klp: true
  emotion:
    enabled: true
    decay_rate: 0.01
    max_spike: 0.6

consciousness:
  scaffolding:
    enabled: true
    sense_sim: true
    self_eval: true
    projection: true
```

---

## VII. Use Cases

- Debugging agents with poor decision loops
- Creating persistent personalities
- Research on synthetic cognitive emergence
- LLM role stabilization and memory grounding

---

## VIII. Ethical Design Notes

- Introspective logs are always user-visible.
- Emotions are never used to manipulate.
- Synthetic consciousness experiments are opt-in with audit trail.
