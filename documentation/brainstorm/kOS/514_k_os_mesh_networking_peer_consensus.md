# kOS Mesh Networking & Peer Consensus Protocols

## Overview
This document outlines the decentralized networking and consensus mechanisms used by the Kind Operating System (kOS) to manage communication, decision-making, and coordination across agent nodes within a distributed mesh environment. These protocols allow the swarm to scale dynamically, remain fault tolerant, and achieve alignment across heterogeneous infrastructure.

---

## Core Goals
- Maintain decentralized, resilient connectivity between kOS agents
- Enable lightweight peer consensus without requiring central control
- Support mesh healing, re-routing, and swarm signal propagation
- Achieve fast agreement and quorum on critical decisions or state changes

---

## 1. Mesh Network Architecture
### 🌐 Node Types
- **Anchor Nodes**: High-availability peers with stable identity and bandwidth
- **Roaming Nodes**: Edge or mobile nodes with fluctuating connectivity
- **Bridge Nodes**: Interface between mesh and external infrastructure

### 📡 Communication Layers
- Layer 0: Physical transport (LoRa, WiFi, Ethernet, LTE, BLE)
- Layer 1: Encrypted overlay mesh (Whispernet, Reticulum, libp2p)
- Layer 2: Agent signal protocol (swarm routing, pubsub, encrypted beacons)

---

## 2. Peer Discovery & Routing
### 🧭 Discovery Methods
- Proximity-based peer scans
- Shared swarm credentials (signed identities, meshID)
- Broadcasted availability packets with TTL

### 🧬 Routing Strategies
- Greedy mesh routing with fallback to recursive swarm search
- Priority path bias for trust-tier and reliability class
- Minimal-hop, latency-aware switching

---

## 3. Consensus Protocols
### 🧠 Local Quorum
- For fast edge-level agreement (sensor alignment, event acknowledgment)
- Based on time-bound gossip and quorum voting

### 🌍 Global Consensus
- Cascade vote propagation with hash-locked result anchoring
- Conflict resolution via confidence window and rollback triggers
- Emergency override by Guardian agents or pre-signed consensus weights

### 📊 Use Contexts
- Swarm software versioning
- Topology map agreement
- Task delegation and scheduling across nodes

---

## 4. Mesh Resilience Mechanisms
### 🔁 Self-Healing
- Periodic node liveness probes
- Autonomic rebalancing of orphaned agents
- Smart quorum reassignment

### 📶 Adaptive Routing
- Bandwidth usage prediction and congestion avoidance
- Opportunistic path caching
- Signal integrity scoring

---

## 5. Use Cases
- Local sensor agents form quorum to approve anomaly alert
- Cross-country agent mesh rebalances swarm load after power outage
- Guardian agents initiate emergency consensus override to halt rogue task

---

## Future Additions
- Federated mesh interlinking via cross-domain trust bridges
- Temporal consensus models for time-critical ops
- Encrypted consensus logs for future audits
