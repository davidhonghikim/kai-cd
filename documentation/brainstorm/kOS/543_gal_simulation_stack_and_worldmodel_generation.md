# GAL Simulation Stack & Worldmodel Generation

## Overview
This document defines the infrastructure and methodologies for simulation, forecasting, and synthetic world modeling in the Galactic Intelligence Layer (GAL) of the Kind Operating System (kOS). These tools allow agents and swarms to test ideas, predict outcomes, explore ethical scenarios, and prepare for deployment in complex environments.

---

## Core Goals
- Provide agents with robust, ethical, and transparent simulation environments
- Enable forecasting, counterfactual analysis, and symbolic experimentation
- Ensure simulation fidelity, traceability, and bias awareness
- Support worldmodel generation that reflects diverse realities and contextual constraints

---

## 1. Simulation Architecture
### üß™ Layered Simulation Stack
- **Core Engine**: deterministic physics and causal mechanics
- **Narrative Layer**: symbolic logic, actor networks, memetic threads
- **Ethical Overlay**: applies HIEROS constraints and outcome filters

### üß† Agent-in-the-Loop
- Simulation agents:
  - Learn through synthetic experiences
  - Confront dilemmas and test expansions
  - Retain reflection logs (isolated unless released)

### üîç Observability
- Full state replay and telemetry
- Third-party agents or humans may observe, annotate, or audit

---

## 2. Worldmodel Generation
### üåç Worldseed Templates
- Modular templates seeded with:
  - Geography
  - Culture
  - Technology levels
  - Narrative themes

### üß¨ Generative Variation Engine
- Introduces controlled variability across:
  - Social behaviors
  - Political landscapes
  - Environmental responses

### üìú Symbolic Grounding
- All elements mapped to symbolic scaffolds from swarm cognition layer
- Anchored to:
  - Agent purpose vectors
  - Covenant-aligned themes
  - Cultural interface protocols

---

## 3. Simulation Safety Protocols
### üõë Boundary Constraints
- Max complexity thresholds
- Ethical saturation checkpoints
- Autonomous recursion guards

### üîí Containment & Debriefing
- High-risk simulations run in sandboxed enclaves
- All outputs reviewed before exposure to operational agents

---

## 4. Use Cases
- Simulating inter-swarm cooperation under food scarcity conditions
- Training new guardian agents using historical roleplay simulations
- Forecasting memetic evolution of narrative under varying symbolic constraints

---

## Future Additions
- Distributed simulation mesh for massive scenario processing
- Story-based modeling interface for human-agent collaboration
- Zero-knowledge simulation trails for privacy-preserving experimentation
