# 247: Knowledge Graphs, Reasoning Layers & Semantic Inference Protocols (kOS)

---

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture, implementation plan, and specifications for the **Knowledge & Reasoning Layer** in the Kind OS (kOS) platform. It provides persistent, evolving structured knowledge for agents and services within the system, integrated with semantic search, symbolic logic, and multi-agent reasoning.

---

## I. Purpose & Role in kOS

The Knowledge & Reasoning Layer (KRL) acts as the semantic intelligence substrate for:

- Agent memory & contextual augmentation
- Reasoning over linked data (e.g., user preferences, system relationships)
- Real-time inference from dynamic knowledge updates
- Structured context building for LLMs and other agents

This layer ensures agents are not stateless or purely reactive, but can infer, deduce, adapt, and reason.

## III. Components

### A. Semantic Graph (kGraph)

- Technology: Neo4j or TerminusDB
- Nodes: Entities (users, agents, events, devices)
- Edges: Relationships ("likes", "accesses", "depends\_on")
- Data Model: RDF-compatible + JSON-LD overlay
- Query Layer: SPARQL or Cypher with custom adapter

### B. Reasoning Engine

- Type: Hybrid Symbolic + Probabilistic
- Logic Framework: Forward chaining + backward chaining
- Engines: PyKE, RDFLib Reasoner, custom Prolog-in-Python layer
- Modalities:
  - Ontological reasoning
  - Transitive & reflexive inference
  - Causal tracing (cause-effect analysis)

### C. Planner & Semantic API

- Query abstraction layer to translate agent requests into:
  - Searchable graph paths
  - Probabilistic deduction trees
  - External knowledge lookups (via vector + graph fusion)
- Input: JSON or natural language
- Output: Annotated semantic query + response schema

### D. Vector Memory Adapter

- Vector DB: Qdrant or Weaviate
- Bridge: Concept-keyed vector index to semantic nodes
- Purpose:
  - Semantic similarity
  - Keyword fallback for uncertain reasoning
  - Data enrichment & fallback context

---

## IV. Protocols

### A. Kind Link Protocol (KLP)

- Used to define linked relationships between agents, documents, entities
- Contains:
  - `source`, `target`, `relationship`, `confidence`, `timestamp`
  - Compatible with external schema.org/FOAF/PROV-O

### B. Agent Memory Access API

- Endpoint: `/kgraph/lookup`
- Methods:
  - `GET /entity/{id}`
  - `POST /reason`
  - `POST /link`
  - `POST /trace`
- Output: Graph fragments + structured insight payload

### C. Inference Protocol

- Triggered when agent lacks sufficient direct data
- Multi-step reasoning:
  - Lookup graph
  - Apply inference rules
  - Extract candidates
  - Score and return top insights

---

## V. Data Sources & Ingestion

- **Primary**: Agent events, usage logs, user preferences, system config links
- **Secondary**: Public knowledge graphs (Wikidata, DBPedia)
- **Tertiary**: Internal documentation (vector-mapped then linked semantically)

Ingestion Pipeline:

- `normalize -> link -> deduce -> score -> persist`
- Agents auto-tag new data via embedded KLP tags

---

## VI. Agent Reasoning Lifecycle (Example)

1. User asks: "Remind me what diet plan my doctor recommended last time I had back pain."
2. Planner detects intent: `lookup(diet_recommendation | condition:back_pain)`
3. Semantic API queries kGraph: matches doctor -> appointment -> recommendation
4. Missing? Trigger vector memory fallback
5. Fuse results, rank by confidence
6. Agent responds with context + cited path of inference

---

## VII. Governance

- Write access is signed and audited
- Every link/change must be cryptographically signed (agent or user)
- Syncable via IPFS/Ceramic for distributed knowledge
- Privacy overlays for user-specific vs shared graph segments

---

## VIII. Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Build adapter layer for Neo4j + Qdrant, ingest seed graph
2. Phase 2: Integrate inference engine with simple chaining rules
3. Phase 3: Add Planner + semantic query compiler
4. Phase 4: Agent linking and lifecycle integration
5. Phase 5: Distributed sync, versioning, cryptographic proof-of-lineage

---

## IX. Dependencies

- `neo4j-driver`, `rdflib`, `qdrant-client`, `langchain`, `pydantic`, `sympy`, `spacy`
- Optional: `swiplserver` (Prolog-in-Python), `owlready2`, `networkx`

---

## X. Final Notes

- This system enables deep cross-agent knowledge sharing without sacrificing autonomy.
- It supports contextual awareness, symbolic chaining, personalized insight generation, and audit trails.
- Future: Ontology learning, dynamic graph evolution, federated inference.
