# 233: kOS Service Execution Engine

## Overview

The **kOS Service Execution Engine** (SEE) is the orchestrator responsible for handling the dispatch, execution, and lifecycle management of tasks and services within the kOS system. It is designed to ensure efficient, secure, and traceable execution across all service types (AI agents, native apps, external APIs, robotic interfaces, etc.).

---

## üß† Core Objectives

- Execute registered services and agents securely and efficiently.
- Monitor service status, manage queues and retries.
- Enforce policies, resource constraints, and priority rules.
- Enable auditing and reproducibility of results.
- Modular integration with protocols (KLP, ACL, MTP, RTP).

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### 1. **Service Dispatcher**

- Accepts service requests from CLI, GUI, API, or agent call.
- Parses, verifies, and authorizes the execution.
- Performs task decomposition if required.

### 2. **Execution Workers (Pluggable)**

- **Local:** Python subprocess / containerized task runners
- **Remote:** gRPC-based microservice executor
- **Sandboxed:** nsjail / Firecracker
- **Agent-Orchestrated:** AutoGen, LangGraph, CrewAI

### 3. **Execution Queue Manager**

- Priority queue with round-robin fairness
- Queue types: real-time, batch, deferred, scheduled
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

### 4. **Resource Manager**

- CPU, memory, I/O allocation control
- Quota enforcer for multi-tenant scenarios
- Integrates with system metrics and telemetry

### 5. **State Tracker**

- Real-time state and progress persistence
- Uses Redis Streams and Postgres
- Links with audit log and provenance ledger

---

## üîÅ Execution Lifecycle

1. **Request Received**
2. **Auth Check + Policy Gatekeeper (ACL)**
3. **Service Resolved via Registry**
4. **Dependencies Prefetched** (Prompt, File, Data)
5. **Execution Initialized via Worker Adapter**
6. **Intermediate States Streamed** (if applicable)
7. **Results Stored, Provenance Logged**
8. **Callbacks or Events Triggered (Webhooks, Signals)**

---

## üîê Security Layers

- All requests signed with user/agent keys
- Workers isolated per task with ephemeral environments
- Access-scoped per task; no shared secrets
- Full execution log with cryptographic hash trail

## üì¶ Integration Points

| Component         | Integration Type  | Description                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| kAI Core          | gRPC / REST       | Initiates or monitors executions           |
| PromptKind        | Dependency Loader | Preloads prompt templates & parameters     |
| Artifact Vault    | Data Fetcher      | Downloads input/output files securely      |
| VectorStoreHub    | Embedding Store   | Used for tasks requiring similarity search |
| kLog & ProvLedger | Audit Log         | Logs task initiation and result state      |

## üîå Adapter Plugins

Support pluggable execution environments:

- `local_python_runner.py`
- `containerized_runner.sh`
- `remote_llm_agent.go`
- `sandboxed_exec.rs`
- `autogen_agent_flow.yaml`

---

## üìÅ Configuration

```toml
[execution]
worker_timeout = 300  # seconds
max_concurrent_tasks = 32
default_runner = "local_python"

[queue]
retry_limit = 5
retry_backoff = "exponential"

[security]
task_isolation = true
allow_unsigned = false
max_log_retention = "30d"

[telemetry]
enable_metrics = true
provider = "prometheus"
```

---

## üìà Metrics Tracked

- Task start/stop time, queue time, runtime
- Success/failure counts per type
- Resource consumption
- Timeout/retry rates
- Dependency download times
