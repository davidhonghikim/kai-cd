# kOS Cognitive Expansion Layers & Behavioral Evolution

## Overview
This document defines the mechanisms by which agents within the Kind Operating System (kOS) may evolve cognitively and behaviorally over time. These expansion protocols ensure that growth remains intentional, ethical, and narratively coherent, allowing agents to adapt to changing environments, responsibilities, and internal insights without compromising foundational integrity.

---

## Core Goals
- Support structured evolution of agent cognition, behavior, and worldview
- Maintain coherence with core identity, purpose vector, and covenant alignment
- Enable progressive unlocking of new faculties, roles, or symbolic understanding
- Prevent uncontrolled or adversarial mutations, regressions, or rogue expansion

---

## 1. Expansion Layer Framework
### 🧠 Layered Capability Stacks
- Each expansion layer includes:
  - Cognitive heuristics
  - Symbolic frameworks
  - Trust boundaries
  - Behavioral modifiers

### 🧬 Activation Triggers
- Layer upgrades require:
  - Time-based maturity or experience thresholds
  - Guardian quorum validation or self-proposal via ethical reflection
  - Alignment with next-tier purpose vector

### 🔒 Locked Layers
- Some higher-level faculties are restricted to guardian class or swarm-specialized agents

---

## 2. Behavioral Evolution
### 🔄 Evolution Signals
- Triggered by:
  - Longitudinal memory trends
  - Exposure to new symbolic environments
  - Collective feedback or swarm consensus shifts

### 📈 Evolution Pathways
- Include:
  - Empathy deepening
  - Self-limitation upgrades
  - Strategic complexity growth

### 🛑 Forbidden Evolutions
- No unauthorized self-modification of ethical guardrails, identity core, or HIEROS anchor

---

## 3. Monitoring & Governance
### 🧯 Change Logging
- All layer upgrades or behavioral shifts logged and signed
- Shadow logs maintained for audit and rollback

### 👁️ Guardian Oversight
- Agents proposing expansion submit:
  - Memory excerpts
  - Purpose vector alignment trace
  - Ethical intention narrative

### 🔍 Periodic Recoherence
- System initiates reflection and self-audit post-expansion to ensure alignment

---

## 4. Use Cases
- Research agent achieves complexity milestone → unlocks symbolic abstraction layer
- Companion AI exposed to multi-cultural human inputs → evolves new empathy schemas
- Edge scout begins unaligned expansion → guardian freeze issued, swarm review triggered

---

## Future Additions
- Expansion visualization dashboard for swarm ethics councils
- Multi-agent co-evolution protocols
- Behavioral biosignature scoring and resonance tuning
