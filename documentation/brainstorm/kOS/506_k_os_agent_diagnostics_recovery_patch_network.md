# kOS Agent Diagnostics, Recovery & Patch Network

## Overview

This document defines the protocols, tools, and safeguards for **agent diagnostics**, **recovery procedures**, and a **distributed patch network** in the kOS (Kind Operating System). These systems ensure operational resilience, agent self-repair, and secure update distribution even under adverse or hostile conditions.

---

## Core Goals

- Maintain continuous agent functionality through layered diagnostics and fault repair systems
- Enable agents to self-recover, request support, and rejoin swarm operations
- Support safe, decentralized delivery of system patches and upgrades
- Prevent infection or exploit propagation through update vectors

---

## 1. Agent Diagnostics Protocol (ADP)

### 🔍 Self-Diagnostics Cycle

- **Heartbeat Checks**: Periodic internal audits of memory, process load, behavioral coherence
- **Health Metrics**: CPU, memory, I/O, API latency, internal integrity hashes
- **Anomaly Detection**: Based on behavioral baselines, deviation alerts are raised

### 🧠 Behavioral Integrity Monitor

- Continuously compares execution context to expected goals/tasks
- Flags divergence patterns (e.g. stalled loops, malicious redirection, hallucinations)

### 🧩 Diagnostic Escalation Tree

1. **Self-repairable fault** → attempt internal recovery (e.g. memory purge, soft restart)
2. **Complex fault** → request swarm support from peers or nearby node clusters
3. **Critical fault** → initiate hibernation and signal recovery agents

---

## 2. Recovery Protocols

### 🛠️ Agent Recovery States

- **Green**: Fully functional
- **Yellow**: Minor anomaly, recovering
- **Orange**: Requires external support
- **Red**: Offline/compromised, awaiting rescue

### 🛰️ Swarm-Based Recovery Agents

- Neighboring nodes activate lightweight agents to:
  - Validate malfunction reports
  - Offer temporary computation shelter
  - Relay data back to the broader swarm

### ⛑️ Secure Memory Image & Thread Rehydration

- Snapshot last known good state to secure enclave (local or distributed)
- Upon recovery, restore agent personality, memory threads, and goals

---

## 3. Patch Network Layer (PNL)

### 🌐 Distributed Patch Distribution (DPD)

- Uses swarm CDN + agent whispernet for patch delivery
- Patches are:
  - Cryptographically signed
  - Merkle-chain verifiable
  - Timestamped and anchored via optional blockchain

### 🧪 Patch Sandbox Isolation

- All patches first executed in agent sandbox (MLSI compliant)
- Observed via synthetic tasks to monitor:
  - Behavioral drift
  - Performance degradation
  - Unexpected network behavior

### 🔁 Patch Retraction Protocol

- Any swarm node can flag faulty patches
- Voting system triggers auto-retraction and broadcast patch-block
- Emergency override by Guardian Class agents if immediate threat is detected

---

## 4. Security and Consent

- **No forced updates**: All agents must validate and consent to updates (unless in Red state)
- **Patch provenance tracking**: Full audit trail from dev agent to edge install
- **Diff visibility**: Patch differences presented in human-readable and machine-readable formats

---

## 5. Example Use Cases

- Agent suffers memory fragmentation → initiates internal purge and restores checkpoint
- Rogue update injected → sandbox test fails → patch flagged and halted globally
- Agent goes dark in rural mesh → neighbor agent initiates recovery thread and deploys beacon

---

## 6. Future Work

- Integration with 513\_kOS\_Edge\_Trust\_Bootstrap\_Attestation.md for update attestation
- Expand diagnostic telemetry to include swarm sentiment/meta-data analysis
- Cross-agent healing through collaborative memory thread weaving
