# 280 - kOS Networking, Routing, and Comms Protocols

## Overview
This document defines the networking architecture, routing logic, and communication protocols within the Kind Operating System (kOS). It supports secure, resilient, low-latency agent and service communication in decentralized or hybrid topologies.

## Network Topology
| Type              | Description                                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌐 Hybrid Mesh     | Peer-to-peer with optional central relay or fallback   |
| 🛰️ Swarm Layer     | Local agent clustering for speed and redundancy         |
| 📡 Edge-Aware      | Adaptive bandwidth, latency, and relay prioritization |

## Communication Protocols
| Protocol         | Function                                             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 📦 RNS (Reticulum) | Lightweight encrypted mesh for local comms          |
| 🔐 TLS/gRPC        | Encrypted, structured remote agent interfaces         |
| 📨 WS/WebRTC       | Real-time, low-latency streaming (voice/video/chat)   |
| 🔁 Pub/Sub         | Topic-based broadcasting and subscriptions            |

## Routing Intelligence
- 🧭 Multi-hop and fallback aware routing
- 🧠 Context-aware relay selection (privacy vs. speed)
- 📊 Load balancing between clusters and fallback nodes
- 🛑 Timeout recovery and auto-path healing

## Agent Comms Layers
| Layer            | Description                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Intent Layer    | Agent goals encoded as message metadata                |
| 🗨️ Semantic Layer  | High-level content, structured or embedded meaning     |
| 🛠️ Transport Layer | Underlying protocol: mesh, relay, direct, API gateway  |

## Use Cases
- 🧠 Multi-agent workflows across home + cloud + edge
- 📡 Device-to-device secure mesh communication
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Decentralized consensus or voting protocols
- 🌐 Failover support for offline-first agents

## Future Enhancements
- 🛰️ Dynamic spectrum detection for offline wireless protocols
- 🧠 Agent-to-agent protocol learning and adaptation
- 📡 Delay-tolerant networking for remote/space environments
- 🧾 Blockchain-based message notarization for auditing
