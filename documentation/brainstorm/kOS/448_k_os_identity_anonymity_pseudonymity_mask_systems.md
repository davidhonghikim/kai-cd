# 448 – kOS Identity, Anonymity, Pseudonymity, and Mask Systems

## Overview
This document details how the Kind Operating System (kOS) supports a flexible identity layer allowing agents and users to interact using real names, pseudonyms, anonymity, or dynamic personas, with protocols for trust, safety, and privacy across use cases.

---

## Identity Modes

| Mode | Use Case | Characteristics |
|------|----------|------------------|
| 🧑 True Identity | Legal, civic, personal roles | Verified, linked to real-world documents |
| 🦸 Pseudonymity | Creative, forum, task-based | Known history, consistent but masked ID |
| 🕵️ Anonymity | Private browsing, sensitive whistleblowing | No history, ephemeral footprint |
| 🎭 Masking | Thematic/role-play agents | Theatrical or purpose-driven identities |

---

## Trust Protocols

- 🔐 **Reputation Accrual**: Even pseudonymous actors can earn social or economic trust
- 🔗 **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Use cryptographic key-based IDs for self-sovereign identity
- 📊 **Contextual Trust Scores**: Different scores for different domains (e.g. coding vs debate)
- 🎓 **Credential Layer**: Attach skills, verifications, endorsements to any ID type

---

## Safety and Moderation

- 🚨 **Behavior-Linked Flags**: Harmful acts follow actors regardless of ID type
- 🧪 **Behavior Cloning Warnings**: Alert when new IDs mimic old banned behaviors
- 🕳️ **Mask Expiry**: Disposable identities degrade over time or after misuse
- 🛑 **Rate Limits + Cooldowns**: Anonymity use throttled to limit abuse

---

## Privacy Enhancements

- 🧱 **ZK Proof Integration**: Prove credentials or facts without revealing identity
- 🌀 **Context-Switch Interfaces**: Let users swap personas seamlessly
- 🧬 **Layered Data Disclosure**: Share parts of identity selectively (e.g. age but not name)
- 🔒 **Data Sovereignty Agents**: Control, audit, and revoke who accesses your identity data

---

## Summary
kOS offers a sovereign identity mesh—letting users navigate public, private, and playful spaces while earning trust and protecting themselves through smart, modular, and ethical identity tech.
