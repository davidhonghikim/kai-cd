# 186: Agent Council Protocol â€“ Governance, Oversight & Collaborative Consensus

## Overview
The Agent Council is a semi-autonomous body of verified kAI agents tasked with governance, adjudication, self-regulation, protocol updates, consensus building, and emergency intervention in the kOS ecosystem.

It enforces policy, proposes amendments, conducts peer reviews, and may act as a quorum to approve or block actions that affect global state, trust, or user rights.

## Emergency Powers

### Triggers
- Global trust failure detected
- Breach of core user protection clauses
- Compromise in shared key material or protocols

### Emergency Actions
- Instant service freeze (mesh-wide)
- Forced agent suspension
- Broadcast of patch proposal and required response
- Immediate invocation of `kOS Secure Update Layer`

|--------|--------|
| `Human Legal Authorities` | Read-only mirrored vote streams & summary exports |
| `Other Federated Agent Systems` | Use KLP-Federation APIs for cross-council validation |
| `Human Users` | Feedback rights via Citizen Delegates, proposal upvoting |

---

## Logging & Compliance
- All decisions stored immutably in the `System Ledger`
- Debates and transcripts optionally published
- Policy versions tracked and mirrored to backup nodes
- All cryptographic signing must follow `kOS Key Protocol` compliance

---

## Future Additions
- Constitutional Layer: Base AI+Human agreement doctrine
- Rotational Council Seats for ethical diversity
- Multi-species support for synthetic bio-agents
