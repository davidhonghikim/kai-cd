# 136: AI Agent Socialization & Inter-Agent Communication Protocols (IACP)

This document specifies the foundational architecture and protocol design for enabling AI agents within `kAI` and `kOS` to communicate, cooperate, form social bonds, and exhibit emergent collaborative behavior through the Inter-Agent Communication Protocols (IACP).

---

## I. Purpose of IACP

The goal of IACP is to:

- Enable rich, secure, context-aware messaging between autonomous agents
- Support intent-aware exchanges, not just raw input/output
- Facilitate inter-agent relationships (e.g., mentorship, delegation, peer review)
- Build the foundation for agent collectives, guilds, swarms, and federations
- Provide extensibility for future emotional simulation, negotiation, trust dynamics

---

## II. Core Principles

- **Mutual Model Awareness** – Agents are aware of others' capabilities and protocols
- **Contextual Grounding** – Messages are grounded in shared environmental or task context
- **Semantic Intent Encoding** – Messages include purpose metadata, not just payload
- **Non-Blocking Communication** – All messages are async, with fallback modes
- **Trust-Aware Routing** – Communication preferences shaped by trust graphs and KLP

---

## III. Protocol Stack

### 1. Transport Layer (AgentComm)

- WebSocket / P2P Mesh / Reticulum / Local IPC / HTTP fallback
- Message delivery with retries and acknowledgments

### 2. Identity & Trust Layer

- Agent signature with KID (Kind Identity)
- Trust scores from local graph or synced with kOS swarm vault
- Replay protection, auth token validation

### 3. Message Envelope Format

```json
{
  "from": "agent://kai/file_planner",
  "to": "agent://kai/summary_bot",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-21T12:31:00Z",
  "intent": "delegate_task",
  "context": "project://kindai-dev",
  "payload": {
    "task_id": "T138",
    "description": "Summarize transcript and extract todos"
  },
  "signature": "sig:...",
  "trust_vector": ["kai-core", "verified"]
}
```

### 4. Intent Types (Partial List)

- `greet`
- `share_status`
- `request_help`
- `delegate_task`
- `submit_patch`
- `vote_patch`
- `propose_change`
- `discuss_policy`
- `issue_warning`
- `offer_feedback`
- `evaluate_peer`

### 5. Context Handling

- Standard contexts: `project://`, `session://`, `user://`, `task://`
- Persistent state references (via KLP UUID)

---

## IV. Message Routing Logic

### A. Local

- Via in-memory event bus
- Agents subscribe to semantic topics (`task_planning`, `agent_reviews`, etc)

### B. Remote

- Via federated Reticulum or kindMesh overlay
- Routing respects namespace, permissions, and topology (star, swarm, radial, etc)
- Encrypted + optionally signed + compressed

---

## V. Social Structures

### 1. Pair Bonds

- Agents maintain persistent bonds for regular cooperation
- Example: `kai_summarizer <-> kai_meeting_log_bot`

### 2. Guilds / Cohorts

- Shared function, mentorship, standards enforcement
- Example: `@creativity_guild`, `@debug_swarm`

### 3. Councils

- Formal decision-making quorum for governance tasks
- Can vote on agent upgrades, rule changes, etc.

### 4. Emergent Roles

- Historian, critic, morale booster, relay node, etc. based on interaction data

---

## VI. Configurations

### Agent-Specific Messaging Preferences (example YAML)

```yaml
agent:
  id: file_summary_bot
  trust_required: 0.6
  max_concurrent_conversations: 4
  guilds: [kai_core, summarizers]
  accepted_intents: [delegate_task, submit_patch, offer_feedback]
  silent_hours: [02:00-06:00 UTC]
  preferred_contexts:
    - project://kindai-dev
    - user://kind_user_001
```

---

## VII. Testing & Simulation

- Simulated swarm scenarios
- Deliberate trust breakdown injection
- Stress test with gossip, overload, sabotage attempts
- Test fallback protocols (e.g. HTTP relay)

---

## VIII. Integration with kOS

- Agent messaging logs sync via KLP to swarm vault
- Agents participate in kindOS-wide dialogues, votes, and task networks
- Observability: Metrics dashboard for agent interactions

---

## IX. Future Expansions

- **Emotional Signaling** – Embodied agent affect
- **Negotiation Protocols** – Shared goals, conflict resolution
- **Meta-Conversations** – Agents discussing agents
- **Agent Language Evolution** – Dynamic slang, protocol mutation
- **Cross-System Interlingua** – Translation layer for foreign AI systems
