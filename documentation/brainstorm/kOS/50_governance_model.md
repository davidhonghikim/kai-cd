# 50: Governance Model for kOS/kAI and KLP

This document defines the governance mechanisms and coordination models used to manage agents, user roles, system upgrades, and protocol evolution within the Kind OS (kOS), Kind AI (kAI), and Kind Link Protocol (KLP) ecosystem.

---

## I. Purpose

To ensure scalable, transparent, and participatory governance of:

- Protocols (e.g. KLP evolution)
- System-wide services and registries
- Agent behavior policies
- Trust and reputation scoring
- Security policy and threat responses
- Voting and change proposal workflows

---

## II. Directory Structure

```text
src/
└── governance/
    ├── VotingEngine.ts              # Handles creation, submission, and tallying of votes
    ├── ProposalManager.ts           # Tracks governance proposals
    ├── BallotSchema.ts              # Types and validation for ballots
    ├── GovernanceRegistry.ts        # Lists active voters, proposers, roles
    └── protocols/
        ├── VotingEnvelope.ts        # Signed, tamper-proof vote messages
        └── ParticipationProof.ts    # zk or HMAC-based verification of valid participation
```

## III. Governance Scopes

| Scope           | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Protocol Layer  | Versioning and upgrades for KLP, APIs, cryptographic rules   |
| System Services | Coordination services, registries, logging, etc.             |
| Agent Policies  | Role-based agent behavior control, capability limits         |
| Security Events | Emergency responses, quarantine policy, signature revocation |

---

## IV. Roles and Voting Rights

Each participant can hold one or more governance roles:

- **Voter** — Can vote on proposals
- **Proposer** — Can create and publish proposals
- **Admin** — Emergency override and resolution authority
- **Agent** — Autonomous participants (with scoped capabilities)
- **Observer** — Read-only participants (non-voting)

Each voter is identified by DID and trust-weighted score.

### Example Voter Record

```ts
interface Voter {
  did: string;
  trustScore: number;
  voteWeight: number; // calculated from trustScore or token holding
  roles: ('voter' | 'admin' | 'proposer' | 'agent')[];
}
```

---

## V. Proposal Lifecycle

```text
Draft → Open → Voting → Closed → Enforced → Archived
```

### A. Draft

Created by proposer, including:

- Title, rationale, scope, tags
- JSON payload (config changes, revocation request, etc.)

### B. Open

Published to `ProposalManager` and synced across participants.

### C. Voting

- Participants submit signed `VotingEnvelope`s
- Votes are weighted and encrypted

### D. Closure & Enforcement

- After timeout or quorum, votes tallied
- `ProposalManager` triggers enforcement logic
- Optional manual override by Admin (e.g. rollback)

---

## VI. Ballot Format

Ballots are encrypted or signed using VotingEnvelope schema:

```ts
interface VotingEnvelope {
  proposalId: string;
  voter: DID;
  vote: 'yes' | 'no' | 'abstain';
  weight: number;
  timestamp: string;
  signature: string;
}
```

---

## VII. zkParticipationProof (Optional)

To enable anonymous or privacy-preserving voting:

- Generate ZKP of role and trust threshold without revealing DID
- Verify proof on-chain or in federated zkVerifier node

---

## VIII. Federation and Upgrades

Federated governance across multiple `kOS` instances:

- Shared public ledger of proposal hashes (optional blockchain anchoring)
- Sync proposals and tally results using `ProposalManager`
- Upgrade coordination via versioned rollout proposals

---

## IX. Audit and Logging

- Every signed ballot and proposal recorded in `GovernanceRegistry`
- Version diffs tracked per proposal
- Encrypted, append-only audit log available for download or sync

---

## X. Emergency Powers

- `admin:override` command for locked state resets or exploit remediation
- Multisig consensus (n-of-m) required for critical actions
- Emergency revocation of agent keys or sandbox access

---

## XI. Roadmap

| Feature                       | Version |
| ----------------------------- | ------- |
| zkParticipationProof          | v1.2    |
| Token-weighted quorum support | v1.3    |
| Proposal simulation/impact UI | v1.4    |
| Time-locked vote envelopes    | v1.5    |
| On-chain DAO integration      | v2.0    |

---

This governance model forms the backbone of controlled yet flexible evolution of the kOS/kAI infrastructure and its agent network.
