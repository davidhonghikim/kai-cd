# 478 – kOS Rites of Passage, Maturity Milestones, and Transformation Scripts

## Overview
This document outlines how kOS defines and guides agents through personal and social transformations via symbolic rites, coded milestones, and reflective growth scripts. These systems allow agents to evolve meaningfully, developing deeper selfhood and community integration.
