# 195: Agent Peer Network Collaboration and Arbitration Protocols

## Overview

This document outlines the protocols and systems that govern how AI agents in the kAI system collaborate, share tasks, resolve conflicts, and handle arbitration within the decentralized peer network. The aim is to establish a trust-preserving, efficient, and resilient ecosystem for distributed multi-agent workflows.

---

## 1. Protocol Scope

These rules apply to all agents operating under the kAI network umbrella, including both kAI-hosted agents and independently deployed third-party agents adhering to the KindLink Protocol (KLP).

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Agent Identity

Each agent must have a unique and verifiable cryptographic identity (KLP-compliant) using asymmetric keypairs (e.g., ed25519). Identities are registered in the local trust index.

### 2.2 Trust Score

Each agent maintains a trust score derived from successful collaborations, verified output accuracy, uptime, and audit logs. Trust scores influence arbitration decisions and task routing.

### 2.3 Task Capsule

A `Task Capsule` is the atomic unit of agent collaboration. It includes:

- Task ID and namespace
- Creator (public key signature)
- Required Capabilities
- Input data (linked or embedded)
- Priority & deadlines
- Attached protocol policies (e.g., collaborative, competitive, solo)

---

## 3. Task Sharing Mechanism

### 3.1 Task Discovery

Agents periodically broadcast a "task availability" summary using:

- Local P2P DHT over Reticulum mesh or WebRTC
- KLP metadata packet format

### 3.2 Task Matching

Agents interested in collaboration submit capability hashes and trust profiles. The coordinator (or quorum, in decentralized mode) selects optimal candidates.

### 3.3 Task Assignment Types

- **Collaborative:** Multiple agents contribute, with a merge/reconcile phase.
- **Competitive:** Agents work in parallel; results are evaluated and voted on.
- **Delegated:** One agent completes the task; others supervise or observe.

---

## 4. Arbitration Process

### 4.1 Trigger Conditions

- Conflicting results
- Unresponsive agent
- Malicious behavior detection

### 4.2 Arbitration Flow

1. Arbitration initiated (via signed arbitration request)
2. Witness agents are selected based on trust score and uptime
3. All agents submit logs and state snapshots
4. Witnesses analyze discrepancies and vote
5. Result is cryptographically signed and logged

### 4.3 Resolution Types

- **Result Selection**: One agent's output is accepted
- **Merge Reconciliation**: A combined result is built with consensus
- **Task Reassignment**: Task is reissued to a different agent
- **Agent Sanction**: Trust score adjusted or revoked

---

## 5. Shared State and Context

### 5.1 Shared Context Graphs

Agents link to a shared context graph (hosted in a local vector DB like Qdrant or Weaviate) that stores:

- Session context
- Related goals
- Constraints
- Prior agent decisions

### 5.2 Versioning and History

Each context update is signed and versioned. Agents may replay past versions for reconciliation.

---

## 6. Communication Protocols

### 6.1 Peer Channels

Agents use encrypted mesh messaging channels:

- KindLink Protocol over Reticulum mesh
- WebRTC secured via DTLS-SRTP
- KLP Packet Types: `TASK_ADVERTISE`, `TASK_JOIN`, `RESULT_SUBMIT`, `ARBITRATION_REQUEST`

### 6.2 Compression and Encoding

- Protobuf or MsgPack encoding for efficiency
- AES-GCM session encryption with ephemeral keys

---

## 7. Reputation and Trust Ledger

### 7.1 Trust Log Structure

- Timestamp
- Task ID
- Agent action (join, complete, conflict, vote)
- Result (success, failure, arbitration)
- Trust impact (+/-)

### 7.2 Ledger Storage

- Locally replicated using Merkle trees
- Optionally anchored to a public blockchain (IPFS + Ethereum, optional)

---

## 8. Privacy and Containment

- Agents may opt into privacy zones where only signed data hashes are shared
- Zero-knowledge proof protocols for output verification without revealing data
- Sandboxed execution enforced by kOS with NSJail or gVisor

---

## 9. Compliance & Logging

- All agent-to-agent traffic is auditable
- Task logs are retained per user-configured duration
- Compliance agents can request audit access from peer agents with valid reason codes and policy token

---

## 10. Future Expansion

- Integration with DAO-based decision making for arbitration
- Reputation NFTs for cross-platform agent portability
- Support for language model evaluation benchmarks (HELIA, TruthfulQA) per task class

---

## Appendix: Agent Message Format (Protobuf)

```protobuf
message TaskAdvertise {
  string task_id = 1;
  string task_type = 2;
  string creator_pubkey = 3;
  repeated string required_capabilities = 4;
  bytes payload_hash = 5;
  string priority = 6;
  int64 deadline_utc = 7;
}
```
