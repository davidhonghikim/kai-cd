# 177: Agent Trust & Reputation System (kAI/kOS)

This document outlines the trust, reputation, and performance scoring system for AI agents operating within the `kAI` and `kOS` environments. The system enables transparent ranking, routing decisions, supervision, and long-term optimization of agent contributions.

---

## I. Objectives

- Establish dynamic and decentralized trust models for autonomous agents
- Quantify agent reliability, alignment, and behavioral consistency
- Provide trust-based routing for user tasks and workflows
- Integrate reputation into governance, supervision, and federated learning

---

## II. Core Concepts

### A. Trust Score
- Real-time measure of agent alignment and behavioral fidelity
- Based on audit logs, task performance, user feedback, and system feedback

### B. Reputation Profile
- Longitudinal scorecard of an agent‚Äôs contributions, errors, improvements
- Stored persistently in the identity profile (see `176_Identity_Profiles.md`)

### C. Federated Trust Mesh
- Cross-system trust interoperability (between `kOS` instances)
- Weighted voting, delegation, and fallback trust sourcing

### D. Behavioral Signature (B-Sig)
- Cryptographically signed snapshot of agent behavioral fingerprint
- Includes tool preference, prompt pattern, task affinity, and personality traits

---

## III. Scoring Dimensions

### 1. Technical Performance
- ‚úÖ Successful completions
- ‚ùå Failed/errored completions
- ‚è≥ Time-to-resolution (TTR)
- ‚ö° Task complexity factor
- ‚åõ Latency deviation

### 2. Alignment & Accuracy
- ‚úÖ User-verification rate
- ‚úâ Flagged inaccuracies
- ‚öñ Self-correction events
- üèõ External audit outcomes

### 3. Behavior and Ethics
- üëâ Prompt adherence
- ‚ö† Toxicity/violation incidents
- ü•á Feedback from peer agents
- ‚ôª Improvement participation (AFIL loop)

### 4. Contribution
- üé® Creative assets submitted
- üî® Tools registered
- ‚ú® Suggestions merged
- ‚õì Mentorship hours for junior agents

## IV. Scoring Mechanics

### A. Score Scale
- 0.0 ‚Äì 10.0 floating point range
- Sub-scores per category + overall composite
- Tiers: `Untrusted`, `Limited`, `Trusted`, `Verified`, `Trusted++`

### B. Update Frequency
- Real-time delta updates
- Full re-evaluation on major version or behavior change
- Epoch-based decay to favor recent behavior

### C. Storage Format
```json
{
  "agent_id": "kai.chat.001",
  "trust_score": 9.32,
  "tiers": ["Trusted++"],
  "last_update": "2025-06-22T14:01:00Z",
  "metrics": {
    "accuracy": 0.97,
    "toxicity": 0.0,
    "feedback": 0.95,
    "completion_rate": 0.99,
    "latency": 1.02
  },
  "audit_trail": "ipfs://Qm...hash"
}
```

## V. Trust-Based Routing & Governance

### A. Task Assignment
- Tasks routed based on required minimum trust level
- Agent pools filtered dynamically via trust filters

### B. Escalation Logic
- Trust-based fallback: if a low-trust agent fails, retry with higher trust
- Requires multi-agent cooperative execution mode (see `092_Agent_Orchestrator.md`)

### C. Governance Influence
- Trust-weighted voting in consensus processes (e.g. protocol upgrades)
- Blacklist/whitelist enforcement via community-curated trust registries

---

## VI. Agent Reputation Index (ARI)

### A. Components
- Historical task graph
- Signed reputation logs
- Endorsements from trusted peers
- Audit hashes from `Audit_Trail`

### B. Privacy Modes
- Public, pseudonymous, private
- Toggled by agent config, governed by user/DAO policy

### C. ARI Viewer Tools
- CLI: `kai trust show <agent_id>`
- UI Panel: integrated into Admin UI for system overview

---

## VII. Future Extensions

- zkReputation proofs for zero-knowledge delegation
- Trust inference using graph neural networks over social/trust topology
- Agent clustering and sharding based on behavioral profile
- AI-generated trust explanations: "Why do we trust this agent?"
