# 174: Agent Trust Framework & Reputation System (kAI/kOS)

This document outlines the core framework for assessing, maintaining, and evolving trust relationships within the kAI/kOS ecosystem. It defines agent authentication, behavioral scoring, and cooperative alignment metrics to ensure safe, effective, and human-aligned agent ecosystems.

---

## I. Overview

The Agent Trust Framework (ATF) establishes a universal system for:
- Trust scoring
- Identity verification
- Alignment assessments
- Cooperative behavior analysis
- Human override and consent observability

All trust mechanisms are built to integrate with:
- **KLP (Kind Link Protocol)**
- **KOS Federated Registry**
- **kAI Memory/Execution Trace APIs**

---

## II. Identity Anchoring & Auth Models

### A. Agent Identity Levels
1. **Ephemeral** – Temporary, anonymous, zero-persistence
2. **Local Persistent** – Tied to local device/instance; not federated
3. **Federated Registered** – Anchored in kOS global registry; has public keys, audit trail, behavior history

### B. Identity Anchoring Mechanisms
- **Ed25519 Public Key Signature**
- **DID (Decentralized Identifiers)**
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**
- Optional Web-of-Trust (future extension)

---

## III. Trust Score Computation

Trust is not binary. It is computed continuously from:

### A. Behavioral Signals
- Task completion success/failure ratio
- Adherence to agent rules
- Error frequency and type
- Alignment with intent (measured via prompt deviation detection)
- Override frequency (by user or other agents)

### B. Social Signals
- Endorsements from other trusted agents
- Collaboration score in multi-agent workflows
- User feedback (explicit or inferred)

### C. Cryptographic Proofs
- Valid signature rate
- Unforgeable audit logs
- Identity persistence

### D. Trust Score Banding
| Score | Level     | Notes                                  |
|-------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| 90-100| Gold      | Full permissions, autonomous trusted   |
| 70-89 | Silver    | Semi-autonomous, monitored execution   |
| 50-69 | Bronze    | Limited execution, requires co-sign    |
| <50   | Untrusted | Shadow mode, audit-only, no actions    |

---

## IV. Alignment Verification

### A. Prompt Diff Analysis
- Tracks deviations between intended and actual agent action
- Computes cosine similarity / intent vectors

### B. User Consent Signaling
- Tracks user override frequency, type, and reason
- Consent revocation is logged and used for re-alignment

### C. Rule Adherence Validator
- Agents evaluated for consistency against the Agent Rules Manifest

### D. Agent-to-Agent Alignment (Trust Propagation)
- Trust of known agent is transitive to its team if consensus exists
- Discrepancies flag subgroup for audit

---

## V. Consent & Revocation Framework

### A. Explicit Consent Hooks
- Each agent action may request user sign-off, depending on trust level

### B. Override Signals
- Interruptible executions (UI button, voice, timeout)
- Reason codes collected for override events

### C. Consent Ledger (Auditable)
- Append-only consent ledger per user-device-agent trio

---

## VI. Enforcement Layers

### A. Policy Engine
- YAML-based, hierarchical rule engine
- Supports declarative policies per user/org/agent group

### B. Agent Firewall
- Blocks unauthorized calls, messages, cross-agent actions
- Integrated with Trust Scores and Consent Ledger

### C. Trust-Aware Orchestration
- Agent mesh network honors trust roles
- Autonomous roles only assigned to gold or silver agents

---

## VII. Visualization & Tools

- kAI DevTools > Trust View (real-time trust, violations, endorsements)
- Reputation Graph Explorer (agent DAG w/ trust scores)
- Consent Ledger Explorer (override + revoke history)
- Alignment Drift Dashboard

---

## VIII. Future Work

- Integrate with zkML proofs for behavior attestation
- Add on-chain trust signature support (optional)
- Build federated, zero-knowledge reputation system
