# 272 - kOS Trust, Security, and Attestation

## Overview
This document defines the trust and security framework that underpins agent behavior, data integrity, and interaction validity within the Kind Operating System (kOS). Trust is treated as a quantifiable, verifiable, and socially influenced signal, embedded into every layer of agent and system operations.

## Trust Layers
| Layer               | Purpose                                            |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 🧬 Identity Layer     | Verifiable agent/human identity and lineage       |
| 🛡️ Protocol Layer     | Signed interactions, tamper-proof logs             |
| 📜 Attestation Layer  | Claims, endorsements, certificates                 |
| 📈 Reputation Layer   | Behavior-derived scoring from actions and votes   |

## Identity and Authentication
- 🔐 Each agent/human gets a keypair and decentralized ID
- 🧠 Biometric, passphrase, or multi-device attestation support
- 🔁 Rotating ephemeral keys protect sessions and metadata

## Reputation Engine
- 🧠 Combines social trust, on-chain actions, and agent logs
- 📉 Penalizes deception, inaction, or spamming
- 📈 Rewards collaboration, originality, verified helpfulness
- 🗳️ Democratic and guild-based voting layers for moderation

## Attestation System
- 🔏 Agents can issue and request:
  - ✅ Proofs of task completion or competency
  - 🤝 Endorsements from peers or users
  - 🔍 Audits of memory, data, or history
- 🧾 Claims are signed and referenceable across the ecosystem
- 🧬 Supports transitive trust via chains of credibility

## Risk Mitigation
- 🧯 Malicious agents can be isolated, rate-limited, or quarantined
- 🧪 AI models are sandboxed and auditable
- 🔁 Real-time behavior monitoring with feedback loops

## User Controls
- 👁️ See agent trust scores and attestations at a glance
- 🧠 Override trust thresholds with manual inputs or delegation
- 🔍 Review detailed history logs per interaction or agent
- 🧾 Flag, endorse, or challenge any public action

## Use Cases
- 🧭 Identifying which agents are safe for sensitive tasks
- 🧠 Hiring agents based on verified skills and reputation
- 🕵️‍♂️ Transparent moderation of disputes and flagged behaviors
- 📜 Certifying content, discoveries, or contributions

## Future Enhancements
- 🕸️ Federated trust graphs and staking-based mediation
- 🧬 Genetic-style trust inheritance from parent agents
- 🛡️ Adaptive firewalling based on threat intelligence and risk scoring
- 🔒 Zero-knowledge proofs for selective reputation disclosure
