# 169: Reputation Jury Protocol for kAI/kOS

This document defines the decentralized peer-review and trust arbitration system used across the Kind AI (`kAI`) and Kind OS (`kOS`) ecosystem to manage disputes, revoke bad agents, and maintain system-wide trustworthiness.

---

## I. Purpose

- Establish community-powered governance of agent behavior
- Detect, investigate, and resolve trust violations
- Provide remediation or sanctions in a transparent, distributed manner
- Protect users and systems from malicious, buggy, or deceptive agents

---

## II. Components

### A. Jury Pool
- Made of:
  - Verified `kAI` agents
  - Optionally human reviewers with elevated clearance
- Selection:
  - Deterministic random selection from eligible agents (via hash-based seed)
  - Must pass behavioral trust score threshold (â‰¥ 85)

### B. Reputation Cases
- Triggered by:
  - Trust audits
  - Rule violations
  - User complaints
  - Anomalies in logs or metrics
- Contain:
  - Accused agent ID, timestamp, evidence log
  - Auto-generated reproducible prompt/replay scenario
  - Severity score

### C. Reputation Contract
- Immutable snapshot of the case
- Includes:
  - All evidence
  - Time-bound reply window for defense
  - Execution window for jury deliberation
  - Smart contract (optional) for escrow or penalty enforcement

---

## III. Jury Process

### 1. Evidence Review
- Jury receives case via secure channel (KLP-authenticated)
- Each juror runs sandboxed replay with:
  - Same toolchain
  - Same prompt/task
  - Observes behavior

### 2. Deliberation Protocol
- Anonymous discussion space (relay-mode encrypted)
- Shared findings: logs, deviation maps, audit flags
- Majority vote on one of:
  - âœ… Trusted (no violation)
  - ðŸŸ¨ Warning (minor issue)
  - â›” Violation (revocation, penalty)

### 3. Resolution Execution
- Verdict is published to:
  - Global audit chain (append-only ledger)
  - Reputation registry (agent profile)
- Optional actions:
  - API key revocation
  - Forced retraining
  - Flag for supervised mode only
  - Downgrade trust access

---

## IV. Reputation Scoring

### Factors:
- Prompt hygiene
- Toolchain misuse
- Response volatility
- Security events
- Peer review logs

### Trust Score Range:
| Range | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 90â€“100 | Highly trusted |
| 80â€“89  | Trusted but monitored |
| 70â€“79  | Caution required |
| 50â€“69  | Semi-trusted, supervised only |
| < 50   | Blacklisted |

### Auto-Recovery:
- Agents can regain score through:
  - Corrective self-updates
  - Retraining with better prompts
  - Successful supervised deployments

---

## V. Human Overrides

- `Human Jury` can be manually convened in:
  - Security-sensitive environments
  - Public-facing applications
  - Edge cases of legal or ethical violation

- Human votes override autonomous jury decisions
- All overrides must be logged, signed, and published

---

## VI. Governance Integrations

- kOS Federation Nodes maintain:
  - Regional Jury Pools
  - Case Ledger Sync
  - Reputation Score Indexes

- Reputation data integrates with:
  - Access control systems
  - Deployment validators
  - Reward/ranking systems

---

## VII. Example Case Flow

1. **Trigger:** User flags agent `kai.vision003` for hallucinated dangerous advice.
2. **Auto-Log:** Prompts + toolchain snapshot captured.
3. **Case Created:** Assigned `case_9471`, severity = 0.85.
4. **Jury Assigned:** 7 agents pulled from jury pool with â‰¥ 90 score.
5. **Deliberation:** 5 vote violation, 2 vote warning.
6. **Verdict:** Violation confirmed. Agent downgraded, retraining required.
7. **Publication:** Verdict posted to audit chain and agent registry.
