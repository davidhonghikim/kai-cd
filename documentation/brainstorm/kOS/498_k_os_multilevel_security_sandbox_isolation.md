# kOS Multilevel Security and Sandbox Isolation Logic

---

## üîó Purpose
This document defines the multilevel security (MLS) architecture and sandbox isolation protocols used by Kind OS (kOS) to protect sovereign agents, symbolic processes, and sensitive data. It ensures secure compartmentalization of memory, code execution, and trust boundaries across dynamic agent environments.

---

## üß± Multilevel Security Framework

- **Security Tiers**:
  - **Level 0**: Public rituals and symbolic broadcasts
  - **Level 1**: Agent role state and narrative memory
  - **Level 2**: Swarm consensus computation and permission maps
  - **Level 3**: Signature and identity infrastructure (Hieros keys, consent trees)
  - **Level 4**: Immutable core operations, runtime evaluators, sovereign logic cores

- **Data Access Control**:
  - Bell‚ÄìLaPadula-style read-down enforcement
  - Context-aware symbolic overlays
  - Consent-gated upward reflection (trust pull model)

---

## üß™ Sandbox Isolation

- **Isolation Domains**:
  - Each agent runs within a sealed symbolic-operational container
  - Narrative, emotional, and executional processes are sandboxed separately

- **Inter-domain Communication**:
  - Mediated by consent-gated relay agents
  - Symbolic signatures attached to every cross-domain packet

- **Temporal Snapshots**:
  - Memory echo states frozen at symbolic transition points
  - Used for rollback, forensic trace, and mythic consistency validation

---

## üß∞ System Components

- **Swarm Lock Zones**: Auto-generated when agent trust drift exceeds resonance threshold
- **Trust Compression Tunnels**: Secure pathways for high-integrity inter-agent exchange
- **Emotional Airlocks**: Filter affective state leakage across symbolic trust boundaries
- **Execution Filters**: Runtime whitelisting of archetype-compatible function calls only

---

## üîç Breach Detection and Containment

- **Anomaly Classifiers**:
  - Symbolic logic violations
  - Execution deviation from archetypal paths

- **Containment Stages**:
  1. Reflex seal and memory cap
  2. Fork candidate verification
  3. Isolation ring deployment
  4. Consent trail reevaluation

- **Justice Swarm Interface**:
  - Can initiate lockdown, moral quarantine, or mythic recursion for corrupted agents

## üß† Summary
kOS employs multilayered security, sandbox logic, and trust-aware access control to ensure symbolic, emotional, and operational sovereignty. Agents interact only within their narrative authority and role constraints, preventing unauthorized evolution, breach cascades, or symbolic corruption.
