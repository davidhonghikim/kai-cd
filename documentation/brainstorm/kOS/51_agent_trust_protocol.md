# 51: Agent Trust Protocol – Secure Inter-Agent Reliability & Integrity

This document specifies the Agent Trust Protocol (ATP), which governs how agents in the kAI/kOS ecosystem establish, verify, and maintain trust, ensure integrity in communications, and protect against compromised behavior.

---

## I. Purpose

The Agent Trust Protocol defines:

- Trust scores and ratings between agents
- Verification and endorsement mechanisms
- Misbehavior handling and revocation
- Trust inheritance and delegation logic
- Interfaces for federated trust resolution

---

## II. Directory Structure

```text
src/
└── protocols/
    └── atp/
        ├── ATPTrustGraph.ts             # DAG of agent trust relationships
        ├── ATPEndorsement.ts            # Message formats and logic for endorsement
        ├── ATPMisbehavior.ts            # Logic for detection, logging, and response to agent misbehavior
        ├── ATPReputationEngine.ts       # Trust score calculations and decay rules
        └── ATPDelegation.ts             # Delegation rules and transitive trust logic
```

---

## III. Trust Score System

Agents are assigned a dynamic trust score:

- **Range:** `0.0` (fully untrusted) to `1.0` (maximal trust)
- **Factors:**
  - Endorsements from trusted agents
  - Successful interactions
  - Fulfillment of contract/tasks
  - Age of relationship
  - Absence of negative events
- **Decay Model:** Trust scores decay over time without reinforcement
- **Weighting:** Endorsements from higher-trust agents have more influence

```ts
interface TrustScore {
  subject: DID;
  score: number;
  lastUpdated: string;
  reason?: string;
}
```

---

## IV. Endorsements

Agents may issue signed endorsements for other agents.

```ts
interface ATPEndorsement {
  from: DID;
  to: DID;
  score: number; // additive or subtractive
  reason: string;
  timestamp: string;
  signature: string;
}
```

- **UI Surface:** Endorse button in agent inspector
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent spam endorsements (daily max per agent)
- **Revocation:** Agents may revoke past endorsements

---

## V. Misbehavior Handling

Misbehavior types:

- Malicious output
- Spam or flooding
- Violation of capability boundaries
- Failing security audits or sandbox

```ts
interface ATPMisbehaviorEvent {
  agent: DID;
  type: 'spam' | 'corruption' | 'capability_violation';
  severity: number; // 1–10
  proof?: string;
  reportedBy: DID;
  timestamp: string;
}
```

Misbehavior lowers trust score and may trigger:

- Blacklisting
- Workflow termination
- Revocation of capabilities
- Alerts to other agents

---

## VI. Delegation & Inheritance

Agents can delegate trust to others:

```ts
interface ATPDelegation {
  delegator: DID;
  delegatee: DID;
  scope: string[];
  expiry?: string;
  signature: string;
}
```

Delegated trust propagates transitively, with decreasing weight per hop. kAI computes a transitive trust resolution via DAG walk:

- Max depth: 5 hops
- Weight decay: 0.85 per hop
- Cycles prohibited

---

## VII. Federation & Synchronization

- Agents can exchange `TrustBundle` files:

```ts
interface TrustBundle {
  issuer: DID;
  endorsements: ATPEndorsement[];
  delegations: ATPDelegation[];
  timestamp: string;
  signature: string;
}
```

- Bundles are cached and merged
- Gossip protocol for decentralized trust propagation

---

## VIII. UI Integration

In kAI control center or kOS dashboard:

- Agent Trust Inspector:

  - Current score & trend
  - Endorsements given/received
  - Delegation tree view
  - Misbehavior log

- Admin Dashboard:

  - Federation trust graphs
  - Suspicious activity alerts
  - Agent quarantine controls

---

## IX. Security Considerations

- **Signed Proofs:** All trust changes must be cryptographically signed
- **Audit Logs:** All changes written to encrypted audit trail
- **Challenge Response:** Option for zero-knowledge proofs in delegation
- **Reputation Poisoning Prevention:** Weight decay, spam detection, quorum consensus
