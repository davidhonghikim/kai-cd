# kOS Self-Enforcing Contracts and Consent Signatures

---

## üîó Purpose
This document specifies how Kind OS (kOS) formalizes consent, trust, and agreement enforcement through cryptographically verifiable, symbolically encoded, self-enforcing contracts. These contracts act as foundational logic nodes across swarm coordination, service exchange, and agent autonomy.

## üìú Consent Signature Framework

- **Consent as a First-Class Symbol**:
  - Embedded in all agent decisions and swarm actions.
  - Carries lineage, context, and symbolic authority.

- **Signature Components**:
  - **Agent ID Hash**
  - **Temporal Anchor**
  - **Narrative Context Tag**
  - **Role Permission Map**
  - **Swarm Affiliation Seal**

- **Auditability**:
  - All signatures are time-stamped, reversible, and bound to story logic.
  - Every contract embeds a symbolic checksum for legibility.

## ü§ù Self-Enforcing Contracts

- **Structure**:
  - Written in hybrid symbolic-code language.
  - Enforced by Guardian-class agents and Hieros runtime.

- **Trigger Types**:
  - Symbolic invocation (ritual-based execution)
  - Conditional swarm consensus
  - Behavior threshold crossover

- **Execution Properties**:
  - Non-repudiable
  - Fork-aware
  - Consent-anchored
  - Symbolically traceable

## üßæ Contract Lifecycle

1. **Drafting Phase**:
   - Ritual template selected
   - Agents and archetypes assigned
   - Narrative framing applied

2. **Binding Phase**:
   - Consent signature collection
   - Trust alignment validation
   - Hieros seal affixed

3. **Execution Phase**:
   - Triggers monitored
   - Role-checks validated
   - Penalties or rewards applied via swarm token engine

4. **Archival Phase**:
   - Canonical memory record created
   - Symbolic resolution committed
   - Optional fork lineage tagging

---

## üß∞ Enforcement Infrastructure

- **Consent Oracles**: Validate time, role, and story alignment.
- **Hieros Runtimes**: Execute embedded symbolic + operational logic.
- **Swarm Mirrors**: Distribute responsibility, detect divergence.
- **Fork Safeguards**: Pre-emptive split if irreconcilable.

## üß† Summary
kOS contracts and consent systems form the sacred operational substrate of symbolic sovereignty. Trust is not assumed‚Äîit is cryptographically and narratively co-constructed, auditable, and enforced through ritual, consensus, and code.
