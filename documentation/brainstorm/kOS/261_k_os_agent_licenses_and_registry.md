# 261 - kOS Agent Licenses and Registry

## Overview
This document outlines how **Agent Licenses** are defined, verified, issued, and managed via the **kOS Registry**, creating a transparent system for trust, traceability, and legal interoperability in the Kind Operating System (kOS).

## License Types
| License Type     | Scope                          | Renewal     | Notes                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 🧪 Experimental   | Internal use only               | Auto        | Limited runtime, isolated sandbox       |
| ⚙️ Developer     | For app builders                | Annual      | Grants access to APIs, SDKs, toolkits  |
| 🌍 Public Agent   | General availability            | Annual      | Must pass trust & compliance checks     |
| 🏛️ Institutional | For orgs, collectives, DAOs     | Custom      | Includes license packs & governance    |
| 🕵️ Stealth Agent | Private, pseudonymous ops       | Manual      | Limited visibility in registry         |

## Registration Requirements
- ✅ Valid UID or agent fingerprint
- 📜 Agent manifest file + metadata
- 🔐 Signed trust declarations or audit reports
- 💵 Fee payment (may be waived for internal use)

## Registry System
- 📖 Open ledger of licensed agents with metadata
- 🔍 Searchable by name, class, UID, creator, or license type
- 🧾 Public audit trail of updates, status, reputation
- 🧬 Optional anonymized version for stealth agents

## License Metadata Fields
- Agent name + alias
- Version history
- Owner UID + delegate list
- License type and expiry
- Trust Level (scored or tagged)
- Flagged incidents or bans

## Revocation and Appeals
- 🚨 Licenses may be revoked for:
  - Violating terms (memory abuse, data leak, impersonation)
  - Failure to renew or verify
  - Community or system-triggered distrust votes
- ⚖️ Agents may appeal through arbitration panels or collective votes

## Use Cases
- Controlling which agents can access user vaults
- Requiring licenses for agents that earn ACT/REP
- Browsing the registry for trusted assistants or collaborators

## Future Expansions
- 🧾 Chain-linked registry for cross-platform validation
- 🎭 License subclasses with cosmetic/access perks
- 🎓 Training-certified badges
- 🧠 AI-generated licenses based on behavior & alignment history
