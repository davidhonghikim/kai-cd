# 89: Trusted Agent Framework & Validation Models

This document defines the standards, verification protocols, behavioral markers, and trust metrics used to establish, maintain, and revoke trust in agents operating under the `kAI` and `kOS` ecosystems.

---

## I. Overview

The Trusted Agent Framework (TAF) ensures that autonomous agents:

- Behave ethically
- Maintain verifiable integrity
- Operate within their granted permissions
- Are revoked or re-scoped upon breach of contract or malfunction

The trust system is managed by:

- **Kind Identity Layer** (KID)
- **Kind Link Protocol** (KLP)
- **Agent Trust Registry (ATR)**
- **Consensus-of-Peers Oracle (CPO)**

---

## II. Agent Identity & Signing

### A. Identity Manifest

Each agent must have a signed `identity.kid.yaml` with:

```yaml
agent_id: memory-agent-001
version: 0.6.4
public_key: "ecc-pub-key"
issuer: kOS-Agent-Certifier
capabilities:
  - memory.read
  - memory.write
  - prompt.inject
```

### B. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

- ECC (Curve25519 or P-256)
- Public keys registered in Agent Trust Registry
- Chain-of-trust for organizational agents

---

## III. Trust Score Model

Trust score is dynamic and context-aware.

### A. Base Score Components

| Category                  | Weight |
| ------------------------- | ------ |
| Authenticated Signature   | 30%    |
| Audit Trail Completeness  | 20%    |
| Peer Endorsements         | 20%    |
| Compliance Tests Passed   | 15%    |
| Behavioral Baseline Match | 15%    |

### B. Score Decay

- Time-based decay without recent endorsements
- Penalties for revoked permissions or flagged behavior

---

## IV. Agent Behavior Monitoring

### A. Audit Trail

- Enforced via `AgentMemory` and `SecurePromptLogger`
- Immutable append-only logs (local + optionally signed)
- Periodically hashed and checkpointed

### B. Real-Time Markers

- Prompt mutation rate (detects hallucinations or injection attacks)
- Memory write anomalies (large diffs)
- Unauthorized API calls
- Identity spoofing attempts

---

## V. Trust-Oriented Capabilities

Each agent declares which trust-gated operations it supports. Examples:

```yaml
trust_gated:
  - memory.immutable_access
  - sandbox.fs_read
  - model.fine_tune
```

These capabilities are only enabled if the agent exceeds required trust thresholds.

---

## VI. Peer Validation Protocol (Consensus-of-Peers Oracle)

### A. Consensus Steps

1. Agent signs proof-of-behavior digest
2. Publishes digest to mesh via KLP
3. Peer agents verify and co-sign
4. Minimum 3 endorsements → valid trust checkpoint

### B. Revocation

- Peers can submit consensus report to ATR to:
  - Flag
  - Suspend
  - Revoke agent trust token

---

## VII. Deployment Classifications

| Level        | Requirements                                | Capabilities                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Trusted Core | Signed by KindOrg, verified by 5+ CPOs      | Full access + secure data zones      |
| Trusted Peer | Publicly verified + endorsed by user circle | Mid-tier access + external API use   |
| Local Only   | Self-signed, no peer consensus              | Sandboxed access, no trust-gated ops |
| Quarantined  | Suspicious behavior or revoked trust        | No access, logging only              |

---

## VIII. Trusted Agent Lifecycle

1. **Registration** → ID & signing via kOS toolchain
2. **Initial Trust Assessment** → Scored via bootstrap verifiers
3. **Active Monitoring** → Real-time trust adjustments
4. **Reassessment** → Monthly or incident-based
5. **Deprecation/Revocation** → Retired or blacklisted
