# 226: Service Bridge Contracts

This document defines the structure, behavior, and implementation of bridge contracts between `kAI` (Kind AI agent systems) and external services or third-party systems. These bridges act as protocol-based translators and validators that ensure compatibility, security, and reliability when interoperating across systems.

---

## Overview

Bridge contracts are responsible for:

- Enforcing a trusted interface between services.
- Translating requests/responses into normalized formats.
- Handling authentication and access verification.
- Performing schema and protocol validation.
- Managing fallback and redundancy for critical operations.

## Core Components

### 1. `llm_bridge.py`
Handles bridging interactions with LLM-based services.

```python
class LLMBridgeContract:
    def __init__(self, provider_id: str, credentials: dict):
        self.provider = load_provider(provider_id)
        self.auth = credentials

    def send_prompt(self, prompt: str, options: dict) -> dict:
        validated = validate_prompt(prompt, options)
        translated = normalize_request(validated)
        response = self.provider.execute(translated)
        return normalize_response(response)
```

---

### 2. `vector_db_bridge.py`
Handles translation and synchronization with vector stores.

```python
class VectorDBBridge:
    def connect(self):
        # Connect using secure transport

    def upsert_embedding(self, uid: str, vector: list, metadata: dict):
        # Translate and submit

    def search(self, query_vector: list, top_k: int = 5):
        # Normalize response
```

---

### 3. `file_storage_bridge.py`
Standardized access to local/cloud file systems.

```python
class FileStorageBridge:
    def upload(self, filepath, metadata):
        # Auth, validation, write

    def download(self, file_id):
        # Read, verify integrity
```

---

### 4. `automation_bridge.py`
Integration with systems like n8n, Zapier, and internal pipelines.

```python
class AutomationBridge:
    def trigger_flow(self, flow_id, context):
        # Check protocol version, queue task

    def get_status(self, task_id):
        # Retrieve normalized status report
```

---

### 5. `media_generation_bridge.py`
Bridges for image, audio, and video AI generation systems.

```python
class MediaBridge:
    def generate_image(self, prompt: str, model: str):
        # Call backend, parse outputs

    def generate_audio(self, transcript: str):
        # Use TTS engine bridge contract
```

---

## KLP (Kind Link Protocol)
All bridges must conform to KLP standards:

```python
class KLPContract(BaseModel):
    protocol_version: str
    sender_id: str
    target_id: str
    payload: dict
    signature: str

    def validate(self):
        # Check version, integrity, and schema
```

---

## Authentication Layer
Defined in `auth_schema.py`. All bridges must:
- Use token- or certificate-based credentials.
- Verify identity before allowing any side effects.
- Record all bridge activity for auditing.

---

## Validation Engine
The `validation_engine.py` must enforce:
- JSON Schema validation of request and response payloads.
- Contract precondition checks.
- Rate-limiting and quota policies.

---

## Logging and Observability
Each bridge must:
- Emit logs in structured format (JSON).
- Tag logs with service ID and action.
- Report failures to `event_bus.py`.

---

## Future Work
- Auto-codec adaptation using AI models for new protocols.
- Hot-reloadable bridges via plugin interface.
- Decentralized bridge registry using blockchain.
