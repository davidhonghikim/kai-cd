# 164: Agent Trust Framework – Identity, Validation, and Risk Management

This document specifies the foundational trust, validation, and governance system for autonomous agents operating within the `kAI` and `kOS` ecosystems. It enables controlled execution, delegation, and collaboration across distributed and semi-autonomous digital actors, with security, provenance, and auditability guarantees.

---

## I. Objectives

- Ensure each agent has a verifiable, cryptographic identity
- Define delegation and permission scopes for tasks and service usage
- Establish risk tiers and trust levels for agents
- Enable federated validation and consensus mechanisms
- Support revocation, challenge-response, and policy-based constraints

---

## II. Identity Model (AgentID)

Each agent is issued a unique `AgentID` identity document at registration, containing:

- `agent_id`: Unique string (e.g. `kai://core.vision/agent/v1/kai001`)
- `public_key`: Ed25519 public key
- `fingerprint`: SHA-256 hash of the public key
- `issued_by`: Authority or domain of origin
- `issued_at` / `expires_at`: ISO-8601 timestamps
- `permissions`: List of capabilities, services, roles
- `risk_class`: One of [`core`, `trusted`, `audited`, `sandbox`, `external`]
- `signature`: Cryptographic signature by trusted issuer

### Identity Storage

- **Local:** Stored in IndexedDB and encrypted local filesystems
- **Federated:** kOS-wide Agent Directory (signed, timestamped agent registry)

---

## III. Trust Classes

| Trust Level | Description                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `core`      | Built-in kAI/kOS agent, full access, zero sandbox  |
| `trusted`   | Signed internal agent with delegated system rights |
| `audited`   | Signed agent with verified behavior and trace logs |
| `sandbox`   | Constrained agent, limited access, no persistence  |
| `external`  | External agent, unverified, requires wrapper guard |

---

## IV. Validation Workflows

### A. Identity Proofing

- Validate Ed25519 signature of `AgentID`
- Validate expiration and issuer
- Check fingerprint in kOS Agent Directory

### B. Capability Checks

- For each system/API call, verify agent `permissions`
- Use real-time trust cache to avoid redundant validation

### C. Agent Behavior Hashing

- Each agent task invocation (tool call, plan step) is hashed
- Hashes are used for:
  - Behavior fingerprinting
  - Reuse prevention / change detection
  - Signature-based outcome verification

---

## V. Delegation

Agents may receive delegation tokens from others to act on their behalf.

### Delegation Token (KLP-Delegation)

```json
{
  "delegator": "kai://core/root",
  "delegatee": "kai://user.kai001/calculator",
  "scope": ["math.add", "math.mul"],
  "issued_at": "2025-06-21T14:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2025-06-21T15:00:00Z",
  "signature": "..."
}
```

- Signature proves grant by delegator
- Tokens stored in agent runtime memory, never disk
- Revocation and expiry honored by all services

---

## VI. Risk Management

### A. Per-Agent Risk Score

- Based on:
  - Trust class
  - Past error frequency
  - User feedback / thumbs down
  - Unexpected toolchain / prompt behavior

### B. Risk-Aware Execution Controls

- Sandbox untrusted or high-risk agents
- Require user confirmation for medium-high risk actions
- Escalation routes to higher trust agents (e.g., `guardian`) if policy requires

---

## VII. Challenge-Response Protocol (Live Verification)

For sensitive actions (e.g., file write, remote API call), agents may be challenged with a KLP-CSR (Challenge-Response) interaction:

```json
{
  "challenge": "Please describe your intended operation on /vault/keys.json",
  "agent_response": "Updating access policy to revoke expired user keys"
}
```

- Used in zero-trust mode
- Logs response and stores in audit chain

---

## VIII. Policy Engine

Policies determine what actions are permitted per:

- Agent ID
- Trust class
- Action type (read/write/delete)
- Resource path
- Context (session, device, environment)

### Policy Format (YAML)

```yaml
- match:
    agent: "kai://user.kai001/calculator"
    trust_class: [sandbox, external]
    action: "write"
    resource: "/vault/**"
  deny: true
```

---

## IX. Revocation

- Revoked agents stored in local and federated denylist
- Revocation triggers:
  - Behavior anomaly
  - Security breach
  - User blacklisting
- Agents must validate their own ID against live directory

---

## X. Future Enhancements

- zk-SNARK based private identity proofs
- Reputational score federation between kAI/kOS networks
- Agent passport format for inter-domain authentication

---
