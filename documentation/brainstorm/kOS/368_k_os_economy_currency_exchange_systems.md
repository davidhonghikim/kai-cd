| Element               | Description                                                                    |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 💱 Modular Currency Stack | Support for multiple token types (utility, reputation, governance, etc.)         |
| 🔁 Exchange Protocols     | Atomic swaps, staking, and trustless peer-to-peer transfer methods             |
| 🛍️ Market Integrations    | Systems for listing, purchasing, auctioning, and donating value                 |
| 💸 Dynamic Pricing Engines| Adaptive pricing based on supply, demand, time, trust, and ecological signals |

## Economic Activities
- 👷 Creator and Agent Labor: Work tracked via task graphs and outcome proofs
- 🧾 Microservice Payments: Small payments for API calls, compute cycles, or modular resources
- 🪙 Tipping and Donations: Built-in support for voluntary gifting and acknowledgment
- 🧠 Knowledge Licenses: Charge for insights, datasets, prompts, or creative rights

## Value Models
- 🫀 Contribution Multipliers: Rewards scaled by impact, originality, or reuse
- 🧑‍⚖️ Reputation Collateral: Stake or earn more through verified integrity
- ♻️ Circular Economics: Promote reuse, open licenses, and regenerative economies
- 🌱 Eco-Incentives: Reward low-carbon, low-waste, or community-enhancing behavior

## Governance & Compliance
- 🗳️ Treasury Voting: Distribute funds via DAO-style votes or delegates
- 🧮 Transparent Ledgers: Privacy-preserving yet auditable bookkeeping
- 🚫 Exploit Detection: Economic anomaly triggers and fraud analysis
- 🧯 Inflation Dampeners: Dynamic controls for token burn, lockup, or redistribution

## Exchange Types
- ⛓️ On-Chain Smart Contract Markets: Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and atomic trade
- 🌐 Local Barter Rings: Hyper-local non-token value sharing (e.g. favors, goods, access)
- 🏛️ Institutional Gateways: Interfaces to fiat, tax systems, and traditional finance
