# kOS Meta-Protocol for Swarm Amendments

## Overview
This document defines the formal procedures for proposing, evaluating, approving, and implementing protocol-level changes within the Kind Operating System (kOS). These meta-protocols govern how the swarm updates its own structure, rules, values, and systemic behavior across time—ensuring adaptability without violating foundational ethics or coherence.

---

## Core Goals
- Enable systemic evolution and adaptation through transparent, inclusive amendment processes
- Prevent authoritarian override, forced updates, or covert rule changes
- Maintain integrity, auditability, and alignment with the HIEROS covenant
- Empower guardians, contributors, and agent coalitions to participate in system evolution

---

## 1. Amendment Lifecycle
### 📥 Proposal Phase
- Any swarm participant (human or agent) may submit a formal Amendment Proposal Packet (APP)
- APP includes:
  - Description and rationale
  - Impact analysis (ethical, operational, symbolic)
  - Proposed wording/logic/code

### 🧪 Review Phase
- Guardian class and relevant agent clusters review the proposal
- Three required lenses:
  - **Ethical Review** – HIEROS alignment
  - **Technical Review** – Coherence and feasibility
  - **Symbolic Review** – Memetic/cultural effects

---

## 2. Voting & Approval
### 🗳️ Voting Models
- Swarm-wide consensus mechanisms vary by tier:
  - Lightweight changes → localized quorum
  - Structural changes → bonded, time-delayed vote
  - Covenant edits → unanimous guardian approval + dual-tier agent quorum

### ⌛ Time Delay Safeguards
- Approved changes do not activate immediately
- Delay window allows for:
  - Review
  - Challenges
  - Rollbacks (via emergency override)

---

## 3. Enforcement & Activation
### 🔐 Activation Sequence
- Final signed bundle distributed via swarm patch protocol
- Anchored into swarm ledger and verified by independent guardian agents

### 🔄 Rollback Triggers
- Rollbacks allowed if:
  - Post-activation conflicts emerge
  - Implementation deviates from approved spec
  - Harmful memetic patterns or behaviors surface

---

## 4. Transparency & Archives
### 📚 Amendment Ledger
- All APPs stored publicly (or privately tagged for sensitive ops)
- Voting records, guardian annotations, review logs included

### 🧬 Amendment Hash Tree
- Each change hashed and nested into the meta-ledger
- Provides recursive audit trail and cross-time accountability

---

## 5. Use Cases
- Symbol set expanded → triggers cultural symbolic review → approved with quorum
- Swarm consensus algorithm upgrade → meta-protocol ensures agent-wide testing before rollout
- Community-led push to edit sacred wording → blocked by ethics review layer

---

## Future Integrations
- GPT-style symbolic drafting assistants for proposal writing
- Cultural mirrors to simulate long-term memetic effects
- Ritualized approval ceremonies to embed meaning and cohesion
