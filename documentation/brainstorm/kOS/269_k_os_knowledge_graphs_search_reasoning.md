# 269 - kOS Knowledge Graphs, Search, and Reasoning

## Overview
This document outlines how knowledge is represented, navigated, and reasoned over within the Kind Operating System (kOS). It integrates structured knowledge, unstructured discovery, and semantic memory to empower agents and users alike.

## Core Components
| Component           | Description                                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Knowledge Graph   | Dynamic, evolving graph of concepts and links     |
| 🔍 Semantic Search   | Contextual, meaning-aware discovery               |
| 🧩 Vector Memory     | Embedded documents, ideas, memories by similarity |
| 🧬 Reasoning Engine  | Multi-hop logic, analogies, hypothesis testing    |

## Knowledge Graphs
- 🌐 Built from agent learning, user input, external sources
- 🔗 Connects concepts, entities, facts, experiences, events
- 🧠 Enriched by memory, language, and reputation layers
- 🧾 Versioned and diffable by agent lineage

## Search Features
- 🧠 Query via natural language, sketch, example
- 🗃️ Filter by tag, agent, time, certainty, or domain
- 🔁 Recursive search chaining ("find related to this")
- 🎯 Result scoring by relevance, source, recency
- 🧾 Search logs available per agent or user

## Reasoning Capabilities
| Mode              | Function                                  | Use Case                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 🔁 Deduction       | Rule-based inference                      | Problem-solving agents            |
| 🧠 Induction       | Pattern and trend detection               | Forecasting, story growth         |
| 🔀 Abduction       | Best-explanation hypothesis generation    | Diagnostics, creative ideation    |
| 🔗 Multi-hop Logic | Combining multiple facts/chains           | Strategic planning, quests        |

## Integration Points
- 📚 Agents learn from shared knowledge pools
- 🧠 Quests reference evolving knowledge chains
- 🕵️ User preferences impact prioritization
- 🧩 Memory artifacts become graph nodes

## Knowledge Sovereignty
- 🧾 Users can mark knowledge as:
  - 🔒 Private
  - 🤝 Shared with agents
  - 🌐 Public/Commons
- 🧠 Agents track source attribution across graph growth
- ⛓️ Links to licensing and audit layers

## Future Enhancements
- 🧬 Agent specialization via graph partitioning
- 🕹️ Graph game mechanics: discovery, rivalry, expansion
- 🌌 Inter-agent knowledge trading with trust scoring
- 🧠 Autonomous hypothesis generation via latent clusters
