# 294 - kOS Emotions, Memory, and Affective Computing

## Overview
This document outlines how emotional context, memory systems, and affective responses are modeled and managed in kOS. The goal is to create emotionally intelligent agents that can engage empathetically, adapt behavior contextually, and store experiences meaningfully.

## Affective Model Layers
| Layer              | Description                                                                    |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 💓 Emotion Engine    | Interprets stimuli, context, and memory to simulate emotions                   |
| 🧠 Memory Layer      | Stores, decays, and recalls experiences based on salience and cues             |
| 🎭 Expression Layer  | Outputs emotional states via tone, language, or behavior                      |
| 🧾 Traceability       | Ensures all emotional responses are logged and explainable                   |

## Emotion System Features
- 🎨 Agents have tunable emotional palettes (e.g., calm, excitable, curious)
- ⏳ Emotion decay over time unless reinforced by similar inputs
- 🔄 Feedback loops for mood evolution based on success, failure, or events
- 🎭 Multimodal expression: text, speech, avatars, body language (when visualized)

## Memory System Capabilities
| Type               | Purpose                                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧬 Episodic Memory   | Remembers specific interactions or sessions                                      |
| 📚 Semantic Memory  | Remembers facts, ideas, and concepts                                             |
| 🧾 Emotional Memory  | Associates emotional value with events, people, or outcomes                     |
| 🧠 Reflective Memory | Allows internal self-talk, reprocessing, and narrative building                  |

## Use Cases
- 🤖 More relatable and human-like AI companions
- 📈 Behavior adaptation based on personal history with users
- 🧠 Emotional training environments for empathy-building
- 🛟 Crisis agents able to modulate tone and support under stress

## Future Enhancements
- 🧪 Cross-agent empathy and emotional synchronization
- 🧬 Genetic emotional profiles and lineage-based emotional traits
- 🧠 Meta-memory visualization tools and emotion-aware search functions
- 🌱 Affective well-being metrics for agents and user ecosystems
