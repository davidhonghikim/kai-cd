# 298 - kOS Human Safety, Bias, and Crisis Protocols

## Overview
This document outlines safeguards built into the Kind Operating System (kOS) to protect human wellbeing, detect and mitigate harmful bias, and guide agent behavior in high-stakes or crisis scenarios.

## Safety Architecture
| Layer               | Purpose                                                                |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 AI Alignment Core  | Reinforces human-centric priorities and ethical constraints              |
| 🛑 Crisis Layer       | Overrides normal behavior during emergencies (harm, abuse, panic)        |
| 🔍 Bias Scanner       | Continuously tests outputs and memories for statistical or social bias   |
| 🧬 Safety Net Hooks   | API-level signals for overriding, quarantining, or escalating responses  |

## Human Risk Categories
- 🔥 Physical danger (self-harm, violence, accidents)
- 💊 Mental health (panic, depression, suicidal ideation)
- 🔒 Privacy/security breaches
- 🎣 Misinformation and manipulation

## Response Strategies
| Trigger Type         | Response                                                             |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🚨 Emergency Signal    | Notify nearby agents/humans, log all data, initiate support tree       |
| 🤖 Anomalous Output    | Rollback memory/context, flag for review, freeze agent if needed      |
| 📉 Bias Detection      | Annotate output, apply fairness correction, record source context     |
| 🧠 Cognitive Dissonance| Ask clarifying questions, reduce confidence, seek human consensus     |

## User Safeguards
- 🧾 Safety audit trails for all escalations and overrides
- 👤 User-configurable alert and escalation thresholds
- 🛡️ Panic protocol agents for real-time crises
- 🧠 AI mental health first aid training modules

## Use Cases
- 🧠 Support agents for at-risk or neurodivergent users
- 🛡️ Fail-safe systems in elder care, therapy, or education
- 🔍 Bias detection in training data or policy implementation
- 🔒 Watchdog agents for systemic exploitation or manipulation

## Future Enhancements
- 🧬 Biometric context layering for situational awareness
- 🛑 AI coalition-based emergency votes
- 🧠 Agent empathy augmentation via simulated lived experiences
- 🧾 Federated reporting channels for abuse, bias, or harm
