# 424 - kOS Kernel and Low-Level Agent Instruction Sets

## Overview
This document defines the foundational operations of the Kind Operating System (kOS), focusing on kernel-level behaviors, microagent execution loops, and a set of standardized low-level instruction primitives that underlie all higher-order cognition, memory, and interfacing tasks.

## Kernel Core
- 🧬 Minimal Trusted Core: Immutable, signed kernel with critical low-level routines
- 🌀 Cooperative Scheduling: Agents yield and resume tasks based on priority, attention, or resource states
- 🧠 Microagent Threading: Enables lightweight, nested reasoning paths and subagents
- ⛓️ Deterministic Execution Mode: Reproducible logic flow for simulation, forensics, or formal verification

## Instruction Classes
| Class              | Examples                                                   |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📦 Memory Ops        | LOAD, STORE, FLUSH, CACHE_SYNC                             |
| 🔁 Looping & Control | JUMP_IF, YIELD, RETRY, BREAK, CONTINUE                     |
| 🧩 Data Handling     | ENCODE, DECODE, TAG, CLONE, PARSE, SERIALIZE               |
| 🧠 Thought Ops       | RECALL, REFLECT, PLAN, COMMIT, DISMISS                     |
| 🤝 I/O & Agent Comm  | EMIT, LISTEN, REQUEST, ACK, SHARE, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE      |
| 🛠️ Tools & Modifiers | APPLY, TUNE, SUSPEND, INJECT, EVALUATE, PATCH              |

## Virtual CPU Model
- 🧰 AgentVM: Virtual execution model that emulates instruction execution across sandboxed agents
- 🔬 Instruction Tracing: Full visibility into instruction chains, dependencies, and performance metrics
- 🗃️ Register Bank: Each agent maintains local temp registers, stack, and value store
- 🧯 Panic Mode: On fatal instruction failure, auto-rollback or halt instructions invoked

## Bootstrapping Agents
- 🥚 Eggshells: Minimal self-replicating agents with hardcoded boot instructions
- 🧫 Seeding Kits: Starter modules injected at first launch or during onboarding
- 🔧 Kernel Builders: Compiler+assembler frameworks for creating new instruction extensions
- 🧱 Instruction Contracts: Define expected execution results and safety conditions

## Extensibility
- 📜 Custom Instructions: Developers can propose and verify new ops via open improvement protocols
- 🛡️ Secure Core Locking: Prevent core overwrite except via approved root routines
- 🔄 Self-Mutating Agents: Instruction flows that evolve based on environmental or social context
