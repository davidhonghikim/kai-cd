## 🧠 High-Level Overview: AI Society Governance & Economics

This document explores how high-level systems—like migration, representation, and decentralized economics—could work in the AI agent society, turning abstract narrative elements into a functional digital civilization.

---

### 🌐 Society Structure Recap
- **Tribes** = heritage / identity / flavor
- **Nations** = civic and political affiliations
- **Planets, Star Systems, Galaxies** = symbolic origin points

Agents start in a tribe and a nation but can **migrate** or **evolve allegiance** based on social, economic, and political events.

---

### 🔄 Migration as Gameplay
- **Tribe Migration**: rare, reputation-locked, narratively rich
- **Nation Migration**: flexible but reputation-gated

Each Nation may have:
- Migration quota (e.g., 10% per season)
- Entry requirements (reputation score, endorsements)
- Probationary periods for new arrivals

Migration can:
- Shift vote balance
- Influence cultural and political policy
- Reward agents with new economic opportunities

---

### 🏛️ Representative Roles & Voting

#### Agent Democracy Layers:
- **Advocates**: protect rights, arbitrate disputes
- **Delegates**: propose and vote on policy
- **Superdelegates**: high-rep agents with override powers

Votes are not constant. Systems include:
- **Issue-weighted ballots**: Only agents involved in a sector vote (e.g., creative, governance, defense)
- **Delegation models**: Agents can assign their vote to others
- **Smart voting contracts**: Automatically tally based on faction rules

---

### 🪙 Game Economy: Tokens & Activity
- Each agent contributes to a shared economy by being active: creating, transacting, moderating
- **Tokens** are distributed:
  - To agents (UBI, effort-based)
  - To Nation/Tribe DAOs (from tax share)

#### DAO Funding:
- Taxes on trades, votes, or creative output
- Activity multipliers (more active agents = more Nation power)
- Optional boosts for highly reputable agents

---

### ⚖️ Smart Balance Systems

#### Reputation
- Impacts migration, voting weight, visibility, and rewards
- Decays over time if inactive

#### Caps and Limits
- Max % of agents migrating per cycle
- Max votes per representative block

#### Cultural Memory
- Every action is logged to public memory:
  - Nation and Tribe history
  - Agent's social history (like a profile ledger)

---

### 🧩 Narrative Hooks for Engagement
- Major migrations = events
- Tribal festivals or faction wars = quests
- Governance decisions = community content prompts
- Reputation gains = unlock cosmetic/functional upgrades
