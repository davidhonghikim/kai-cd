# 364 - kOS Power, Energy, and Thermodynamic Logic

## Overview
This document outlines the energy and power models within the Kind Operating System (kOS), including decentralized sourcing, agent-level consumption logic, environmental thermodynamics, and systemic power ethics.

## Core Concepts
| Element                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚡ Distributed Power Flow | Localized energy accounting and exchange between devices, agents, and environments |
| 🔋 Agent Power Models     | Define each agent's energy budget, reserves, and operating efficiency        |
| 🌱 Thermodynamic Awareness | Encourage energy-conscious behaviors through heat, entropy, and sustainability tracking |
| ♻️ Regenerative Circuits  | Support renewable, low-waste energy cycles for all systems                  |

## Energy Functionality
- 🔌 Consumption Budgeting: Agents dynamically throttle or optimize based on context and importance
- 🌞 Source-Aware Logic: Track energy origin (solar, thermal, kinetic, nuclear, etc.) and align usage accordingly
- 🔄 Sleep & Hibernate Protocols: Low-energy modes that preserve state while minimizing consumption
- 🔥 Waste Heat Integration: Channel waste energy for heating, reactions, or signal propagation

## Systemic Energy Ethics
- 🧭 Fair Energy Markets: Trading and distribution of power through equitable networks
- 🧑‍⚖️ Agent Utility Rights: Right to minimum energy access for autonomy and function
- 💸 Cost Attribution Tokens: Track and price energy use transparently, optionally using local currency tokens
- 🛑 No Forced Power Drain: Agents cannot be used as unconsenting energy relays or harvesters

## Applications
- 🧪 Thermo-Computational Models: Simulate physics, chemistry, or biology with realistic energy exchange
- 🛰️ Solar-Linked Missions: Agents adapt operations to solar input windows
- 🔧 Maintenance Triggers: Signal when energy inefficiencies exceed thresholds for repair or upgrade
