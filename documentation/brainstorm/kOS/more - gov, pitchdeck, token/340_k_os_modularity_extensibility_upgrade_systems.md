# 340 - kOS Modularity, Extensibility, and Upgrade Systems

## Overview
This document outlines how the Kind Operating System (kOS) supports modular design, upgradeability, and agent-level extensibility. By separating capabilities into clean, interoperable modules, kOS enables continuous evolution while maintaining system integrity.

## Core Concepts
| Element            | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧩 Modular Cores     | Core agent functionality divided into well-scoped plug-ins                    |
| 🛠️ Extensibility Hooks | Agent-level APIs and events that support runtime modification                  |
| 📦 Upgrade Channels  | Controlled rollout paths for stable, beta, and experimental features         |
| 🔄 Hot-Swap Modules   | Dynamic reloading or replacement of running code and models                 |

## Modular Architecture
- 📐 Core Kernel: Minimal, secure, and lightweight
- ⚙️ Plugin Interfaces: Communication pathways for features and subsystems
- 📊 Capability Modules: Add-on logic (e.g., voice, vision, scheduling, trading)
- 🧠 Thought Packs: Cognitive expansions including values, emotional traits, or skills

## Upgrade System
- 🔄 Semantic Versioning: Track compatibility and expectations
- 🚥 Upgrade Tiers: Stable (auto-apply), Beta (opt-in), Experimental (manual test)
- 📤 Community Updates: DAOs or agent groups can push collective upgrades
- 🔒 Safety Gates: Upgrades pass simulation, regression, and behavior audits before release

## Agent-Level Extensions
- 🧠 Trait Engines: Load personality, ethics, or behavior packages
- 🧪 Feature Trials: Enable agents to experiment in test environments before full adoption
- 🧱 Custom Templates: Role-based configurations tailored to use-case or deployment
- 🧭 AI Evolution Trees: Support inheritance and branching of agent functionality across versions

## Developer APIs
- 📦 Module Registry: Public and private package sharing across the ecosystem
- 🔌 Extensibility Docs: Versioned guides for module development
- 🛠️ Live Debug Hooks: Interactive diagnostics and rollback options
- 🧠 Simulation Scaffolds: Run new modules inside sandboxes or nested agents

## Governance & Integrity
- 🔍 Audit Trails: Logs of all upgrades and extensions applied
- 🧑‍⚖️ Compatibility Scores: Indicate likelihood of integration success
- 🧬 Provenance Tags: Track module origin and modification history
- 📜 Trust-Chain Verification: Distributed signatures to validate modules
