# 445 – kOS Coalitions, Alliances, Federations, and Separation Protocols

## Overview
This document outlines how kOS supports inter-agent and inter-community diplomacy through structured coalition-building, alliance formation, federated governance, and graceful separation processes. It ensures scalable, respectful collaboration—and conscious uncoupling when values diverge.

## Union Types in kOS

| Structure | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🤝 Coalition | A temporary or purpose-driven collaboration of agents or nodes |
| 🛡️ Alliance | A more durable, strategic alignment based on shared principles or needs |
| 🏛️ Federation | A nested, semi-autonomous system of self-governing units under common frameworks |
| ✂️ Separation | A voluntary or negotiated disengagement of one or more parties |

## Federated Governance

- 🧭 **Meta-Constitution Layer**: Overarching rights, responsibilities, and principles
