# 289 - kOS Conflict Resolution, Court Systems, and Dispute Protocols

## Overview
This document defines decentralized systems for resolving disagreements, enforcing rules, and managing justice across agent and human interactions within the Kind Operating System (kOS). The framework supports modular conflict handling, arbitration, and appeals.

## Dispute Lifecycle
| Stage               | Description                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧾 Filing               | Agent or human logs a complaint or rule violation                   |
| 🧠 Review               | Community or delegate agents assess evidence                        |
| ⚖️ Resolution Path      | Mediation, arbitration, or tribunal process initiated               |
| 📜 Verdict + Logging    | Outcome is recorded immutably and optionally enforced               |

## Court Types

|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 👥 Peer Court         | Small agent/human jury randomly selected for light conflicts       |
| 🧑‍⚖️ Expert Court       | Domain-specific cases (e.g. licensing, IP, protocol misuse)         |
| 🤖 AI Arbitration      | Fast automated logic on verifiable data or scoring-based issues    |
| 🌐 DAO Court           | Elected delegates resolve high-stakes or community-wide decisions  |
