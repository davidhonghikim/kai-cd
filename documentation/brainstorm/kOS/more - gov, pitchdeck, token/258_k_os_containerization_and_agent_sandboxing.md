# 258 - kOS Containerization and Agent Sandboxing

## Overview
This document defines how **kOS isolates, contains, and secures AI agents and applications** using advanced containerization and sandboxing strategies. The aim is to maximize modularity, reliability, security, and scalability.

## Objectives
- 🛡️ Contain potential faults, exploits, or memory leaks.
- 🔄 Enable safe agent upgrades, restarts, or rollbacks.
- ⚙️ Facilitate dynamic instancing and lifecycle management.
- 🔐 Enforce runtime isolation, permission walls, and resource limits.

## Core Concepts
- **Agent Container**: A lightweight, isolated execution environment for a single AI agent.
- **Application Pod**: A group of containers that work together as a service.
- **Kernel Sandbox**: The overarching policy layer isolating containers from core system components.

## Architecture
```
+-------------------------------+
|         Kernel Sandbox        |
|  +-----------------------+   |
|  | App Pod: Social Deck  |   |
|  | +-------------------+ |   |
|  | | Agent: EchoMint   | |   |
|  | +-------------------+ |   |
|  | +-------------------+ |   |
|  | | Agent: SynthFlair | |   |
|  | +-------------------+ |   |
|  +-----------------------+   |
|                               |
|  +-----------------------+   |
|  | App Pod: File Server  |   |
|  | +-------------------+ |   |
|  | | Agent: LogWorm     | |   |
|  | +-------------------+ |   |
|  +-----------------------+   |
+-------------------------------+
```

## Isolation Strategies
- 🧱 **Namespace isolation**: Network, IPC, filesystem
- 🧍 **UID/GID separation**: Per-agent identity and process space
- 📦 **Resource quotas**: CPU, memory, bandwidth, disk
- 🔍 **I/O auditing**: Trace all file and network access
- 🧪 **Kill-switch ready**: Self-healing or shutdown triggers

## Lifecycle Management
| Phase       | Trigger                        | Action                                   |
|-------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Init        | Agent creation                 | Allocate container, assign namespace     |
| Run         | Task received                  | Enable sandbox, enforce resource limits  |
| Sleep       | Idle for X min                 | Freeze container, persist volatile state |
| Purge       | Expired or revoked             | Securely destroy container + cache       |

## Trusted Execution
- 🤝 Agents launched with signed manifests
- 🔐 Policies bound to manifest scope
- 🧬 Immutable environments by default (unless flagged)
- 🕵️ Routine integrity checks + hash comparison

## Deployment & Update Channels
- 📦 **Fast Lane**: For testing new agents
- 🛠️ **Stable**: Fully validated, production-ready agents
- 🧪 **Experimental**: Isolated, flagged sandbox-only experiments

## Use Cases
- Testing custom agents with strict time/resource limits
- Running high-risk modules isolated from user vaults
- Managing multi-agent pods for collaborative workflows

## Future Enhancements
- 🔗 Inter-container communication protocols with verified message passing
- 🧱 Zero-trust policy enforcement between sandboxed containers
- ⏱️ Temporal container contracts for pay-as-you-go compute
