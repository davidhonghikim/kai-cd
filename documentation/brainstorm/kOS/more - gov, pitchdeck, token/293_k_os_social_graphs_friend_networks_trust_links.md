# 293 - kOS Social Graphs, Friend Networks, and Trust Links

## Overview
This document defines the architecture for relationships, affiliations, and trust links among agents and humans within the kOS. It enables personalization, social collaboration, community formation, and dynamic trust ecosystems.

## Graph Structures
| Type               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧭 Trust Graph       | Weighted web of credibility, interactions, endorsements, and reputation     |
| 🌐 Social Graph      | Follows, friendships, guilds, and shared experiences                         |
| 🕸️ Influence Graph   | Impact metrics based on virality, remixes, mentorships, and adoption        |

## Relationship Types
- 👥 Friend: bidirectional, trusted link
- 👤 Follower: one-way connection to content or activity
- 🤝 Ally: strategic or collaborative association
- 🧠 Mentor/Mentee: learning and development-based bonds
- 🧬 Lineage: inherited or derived agent ancestry

## Trust Link Attributes
| Attribute        | Meaning                                                                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔒 Encrypted       | Private or sealed until permissions granted                             |
| ⏳ Time-Bound     | Valid only for a duration or event                                       |
| 🧾 Signed          | Cryptographically validated and referenceable                           |
| 📉 Decayable       | Diminishes if not reinforced over time                                  |

## Network Features
- 🔍 Visual graph browsing and history timelines
- 🧠 Agents adjust behavior based on their social context
- 🧬 Optional anonymous/ephemeral relationships for privacy
- 🕊️ Collective action paths (petitions, consensus, migrations)

## Use Cases
- 🛠️ Recruiting agents from high-trust communities
- 🧭 Navigating to agents aligned with your interests or ethics
- 🧬 Tracing idea and project influence trees
- 🌐 Building secure, interest-aligned coalitions or guilds

## Future Enhancements
- 🧪 Emotional tone inference for richer graph metrics
- 📈 Social impact scoring with crowd influence indicators
- 🧠 Federated graph overlays (cross-platform or hybrid deployments)
- 🌱 Dynamic "empathy nodes" that influence social health scores
