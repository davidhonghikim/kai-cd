# 290 - kOS Knowledge Management, Ontology, and Semantic Web

## Overview
This document defines the strategies and systems kOS uses to store, link, and reason over knowledge in a structured, explainable, and machine-accessible format. Knowledge is viewed as a shared commons, organized into ontologies and continuously evolving via agent and human interaction.

## Core Concepts
| Concept          | Purpose                                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📚 Ontologies      | Structured schemas representing concepts, relationships, and rules |
| 🧠 Knowledge Graphs| Linked entities across time, space, agents, and topics              |
| 🪢 Semantic Tags   | Enriched metadata for context, trust, and usage logic               |
| 🧾 Source Trails   | Traceable paths to original sources or provenance proofs            |

## Knowledge Curation
- 📥 Knowledge is extracted from agent logs, public data, uploads, and interactions
- 🧠 AI-assisted reasoning adds hypotheses, contradictions, and alignment suggestions
- 🧾 Contributors and citations are rewarded and embedded into data structures
- 🔍 Epistemic score derived from freshness, trust, usage, and consensus

## Ontology System
| Layer              | Description                                                        |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧬 Core Ontology     | Universal structure shared by all agents                          |
| 🛠️ Domain Ontologies | Special-purpose taxonomies for science, art, law, etc.             |
| 🔁 User Ontologies   | Personal schemas, tags, and mappings with optional publication     |

## Tools and Interfaces
- 📐 Graph viewers and query interfaces (SPARQL-like or natural language)
- 🔄 Agents can embed, cite, and crosswalk ontologies in real time
- 🧠 Semantic diff tools to detect drift, contradiction, or discovery
- 📦 Bundled knowledge packs for offline or federated deployments

## Use Cases
- 📜 Research assistants validating cross-domain logic
- 🧠 Collective memory for swarm decision optimization
- 📚 Curriculum builders using verified concepts and dependencies
- 🧬 Ontology-driven simulations, training, and storyworlds

## Future Enhancements
- 🧠 Multimodal knowledge integration (visual, audio, symbolic)
- 🔗 Inter-agent ontology syncing and dialect reconciliation
- 🔍 Fact-checking overlays tied to real-world news or claims
- 🕸️ Interoperability with the broader semantic web and linked data networks
