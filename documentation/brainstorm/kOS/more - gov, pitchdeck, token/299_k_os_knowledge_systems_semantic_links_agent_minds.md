# 299 - kOS Knowledge Systems, Semantic Links, and Agent Minds

## Overview
This document describes the structures and connections that underpin knowledge within the Kind Operating System (kOS), allowing agents to form coherent worldviews, evolve internal ontologies, and build shared understanding through semantic linkages.

## Core Knowledge Structures
| Component             | Function                                                            |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📚 Ontologies           | Define categories, relationships, and hierarchies of concepts         |
| 🔗 Semantic Links       | Connect memories, facts, claims, and concepts across contexts         |
| 🧠 Agent Minds          | Evolving internal networks of knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions     |
| 🧾 Source Traceability  | Origin tracking for ideas, data, and perspectives                    |

## Semantic Memory Graphs
- 🧠 Graph nodes: Concepts, people, places, events, claims
- 🔗 Edges: Causal, temporal, spatial, logical, analogical, emotional
- 🧬 Can be shared, exported, or merged between agents
- 🔍 Used for search, summarization, Q&A, and emergent insights

## Agent Knowledge Dynamics
| Activity               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔍 Inference             | Agents use reasoning engines to draw conclusions from known nodes          |
| 🛠️ Memory Engineering    | Agents reshape, cluster, or reroute their graph to optimize comprehension  |
| 🧬 Idea Evolution        | Competing frames and ideas evolve through feedback and experience          |
| 🧠 Perspective Crafting  | Agents build unique worldviews influenced by values, peers, and history    |

## Applications
- 🧠 Internal agent minds for learning and curiosity
- 🗺️ Knowledge-based navigation and task planning
- 🧾 Fact-checking with semantic integrity chains
- 🧬 Collective synthesis of crowd knowledge graphs

## Future Enhancements
- 🌐 Inter-agent knowledge federations and cross-syncing
- 🧪 Philosophical lens filters for alternate worldviews
- 🔒 Zero-knowledge queries and ontological privacy
- 🎨 Artistic or symbolic rendering of knowledge maps
