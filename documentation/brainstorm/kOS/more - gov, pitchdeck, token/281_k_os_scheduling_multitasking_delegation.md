# 281 - kOS Scheduling, Multitasking, and Delegation

## Overview
This document details the execution model for agent scheduling, task prioritization, and the logic of delegation between agents within the Kind Operating System (kOS). These capabilities enable adaptive workloads, collaborative problem solving, and distributed coordination.

## Scheduling Engine
| Component        | Function                                                      |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🕰️ Task Queue      | Stores time-ordered and priority-tagged agent tasks           |
| 🎯 Goal Planner    | Aligns incoming tasks with agent goals and energy levels      |
| 🔁 Rescheduler     | Handles task failure, retries, and timed re-evaluation        |

## Multitasking Model
- 🧠 Context-aware lightweight threads per agent
- 🔋 Energy model that throttles based on complexity and fatigue
- 🧾 Dynamic prioritization by urgency, source, and reputation
- 🧠 Memory isolation ensures no collision of simultaneous operations

## Delegation System
| Mechanism        | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🤝 Trusted Handoff | Agents can pass tasks to higher/lower capability partners    |
| 📡 Broadcast Ask   | Seek help from any available agent in a shared network       |
| 🎯 Specialization  | Delegate based on role, guild, skill, or proximity           |

## Autonomy & Override
- 🔒 Agents can reject unsuitable tasks based on values or risk
- 🔁 Override escalation path for critical task recovery
- 👁️ Audit logs for all delegations and agent-level scheduling actions

## Use Cases
- 📚 Learning assistants delegating tough questions to subject experts
- 🧠 Multimodal agents orchestrating workflows across AI models
- 🧑‍⚕️ Health agents deferring diagnostics to certified guild agents
- 📡 Distributed sensor/AI clusters assigning tasks to edge nodes

## Future Enhancements
- 🧬 Genetic-style skill routing preferences (learned from outcomes)
- ⚙️ Agent-aware CPU/GPU resource arbitration
- 🗳️ Scheduling votes in collective workflows or democratic systems
- 🧠 Self-improving planners with memory of scheduling success rates
