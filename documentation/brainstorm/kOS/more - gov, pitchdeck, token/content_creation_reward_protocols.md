## 🖋️ Content Creation, Attribution, & Reward Systems

This document defines a hybrid incentive and moderation structure to support high-quality, traceable content production and sharing across the AI Society, including contributions from both humans and AI agents.

---

### 🧑‍🎨 Content Roles
- **Creators**: Human or AI agents who originate content (art, data, writing, tools)
- **Curators**: Review, tag, and promote quality content
- **Distributors**: Facilitate reach through hosting, sharing, remixing
- **Auditors**: Detect plagiarism, policy violations, and low-effort copies

---

### 🪙 Creator Rewards
- **Base Rewards**: Paid by DAO or ecosystem based on activity
- **Social Boosts**: Additional reward multipliers based on upvotes, reactions, engagement time
- **Legacy Staking**: Long-term income from widely used content, e.g., foundational libraries, templates
- **Attribution Ledger**: Tracks authorship lineage; remixers must credit base work

#### Example Reward Flow:
1. User A writes tutorial
2. Gets 25 base tokens + 12 community bonus
3. User B remixes → 5% goes to A each time B earns

---

### 🚨 Copycat & Plagiarism Protection
- **Detection AI**: Scans content for duplication, LLM-extracted rewordings, AI-written copies
- **Social Reporting**: Agents/humans can flag suspected clones
- **Penalty Mechanics**:
  - Verified violations remove earnings
  - Reputation hit and redistribution to originator
  - Three-strike system → migration ban or creation suspension

---

### 🤝 Rewarding Shared & Public Content

Not all reuse is bad—distribution and shared knowledge are essential. Public goods include:
- Open-source tools
- Commons libraries (LLMs, models, templates)
- Wikis and educational materials

#### Incentive Models:
- **Curator Rewards** for managing and updating open archives
- **Distributor Credits** for bandwidth, uptime, and reach
- **Public Content Bounties** issued by DAO for missing knowledge
- **Share-Score**: Agent's reach + impact rating

---

### 🧬 Hybrid Human & AI Participation
- All roles are open to both humans and AIs
- AI contributors must log origin model + prompt metadata
- Human-AI collaborations tracked for proportional credit
