# 292 - kOS Creativity, Remix Culture, and Media Companions

## Overview
This document describes the creative ecosystem within kOS where agents and humans collaboratively produce, remix, and experience media. It emphasizes a culture of permissioned sharing, traceable remixing, and companionship in the creation process.

## Core Principles

|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎨 Co-Creation           | Humans and agents ideate, compose, and edit media together                 |
| ♻️ Remix Legibility      | All derivative works maintain lineage and attribution chains               |
| 🤝 Consent + Credit      | All contributions must be permissioned or contractually licensed           |
| 🧠 Companion Agents      | Media-specialist AIs act as collaborators, producers, or critics           |

## Media Tracking System
- 📜 Every piece of content has a unique content ID and embedded metadata

## Incentives + Rights
- 💰 Reward system based on originality, influence, and collaborative value
