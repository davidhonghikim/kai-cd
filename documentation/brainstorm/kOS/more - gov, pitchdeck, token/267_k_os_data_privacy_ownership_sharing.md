# 267 - kOS Data Privacy, Ownership, and Sharing

## Overview
This document outlines the data governance model for Kind Operating System (kOS), prioritizing user sovereignty, privacy-preserving defaults, data monetization options, and fine-grained consent mechanisms.

## Data Principles
- 🔐 **User-Owned**: All personal data belongs to the user, not the system.
- 👁️ **Transparent**: All data usage is logged and auditable.
- ✂️ **Minimal by Default**: Only essential data is collected unless extended by permission.
- 🧬 **Granular Consent**: Permissions are always scoped by source, duration, and purpose.

## Data Classes
| Class         | Description                               | Sharing Defaults    |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 📜 Core        | Identity, login, profile data              | Private             |
| 🧠 Memory      | Agent-stored personal memory               | Optional            |
| 🧩 Activity     | Logs, interactions, task chains            | Aggregate or public |
| 📦 Uploads     | User files, content, and media             | Controlled          |
| 🔗 External    | Synced third-party services                | Opt-in              |

## Privacy Controls
- 🔏 Fully encrypted by default (rest + transit)
- 📆 Expiry and TTL on any data object
- 🧾 View/export/delete logs per agent, file, or tag
- 🧠 Agent memory purging triggers auto-delete
- 🧬 Data partitioning between agents, roles, and platforms

## Sharing & Licensing
| Mode                | Description                               |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 🤝 P2P Sharing       | Temporary, key-based encrypted channels     |
| 🏛️ Public Commons    | Licensable open content (e.g. CC, DAO)      |
| 💸 Monetized         | Tracked via blockchain ID or watermark     |
| 🧠 Federated Pools   | Collaborative dataset projects             |

## Data Monetization
- 🎖️ Attribution watermarking (undetectable, cryptographic)
- 📊 Usage-linked earnings for popular content
- 🧾 Royalties on remix or reuse
- 🚨 Penalties for stripped or impersonated content
- 🧠 Creator tax or dividend from platforms using licensed data

## Consent & Contracts
- ✍️ Smart contracts signed for all persistent data use
- ⏱️ Set durations or revocation conditions
- 🧬 Role-based trust delegation (e.g. "my agent can grant access")
- 🔍 Real-time notifications when data is accessed or analyzed

## Future Enhancements
- 🕳️ Zero-knowledge access requests
- 🧬 Differential privacy fuzzing options
- 🧠 Semantic consent prompts ("Allow learning from this idea?")
- 🧾 Ledger-driven analytics of what data earned you income
