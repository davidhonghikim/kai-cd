# 260 - kOS User Identity and Agent Association

## Overview
This document defines how **User Identity** is represented and managed in the Kind Operating System (kOS), and how **Agents** are securely associated, delegated, and scoped under a user or collective identity.

## Identity Types
- 🧍 **Human User**: A verified entity using kOS via credentials, biometrics, or keys.
- 🤖 **Autonomous Agent**: A self-acting system instance with its own identity fingerprint.
- 👥 **Collective Identity**: Group identity (e.g., DAO, household, company, tribe) capable of managing multiple agents/users.

## Core Concepts
- **UID (Universal Identity)**: Globally unique, non-sequential identity assigned to every user or agent.
- **Keyring**: Each identity manages cryptographic keys, permissions, and recovery credentials.
- **Agent Wallet**: Each agent maintains their own sub-wallet for ACT/REP + memory permissions.

## Association Types
| Type           | Direction | Auth Required | Description                          |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| Primary        | 1:1       | Yes           | User creates and owns the agent      |
| Delegated      | 1:N       | Yes           | User delegates control temporarily   |
| Autonomous     | 0:1       | No            | Agent operates self-owned            |
| Transferred    | 1:1       | Yes           | Ownership passed between users       |

## Association Mechanics
- 🧾 All links are timestamped and cryptographically signed
- 🔁 Dynamic re-association is permitted with quorum/consent
- 🔐 Key-based challenge-responses validate re-ownership
- 🗂️ All associations are auditable, revocable, and exportable

## Identity Verification
- 🔐 Multi-factor auth for root identity actions
- 🧬 Optional biometric or device token pairing
- 🕵️‍♂️ Optional zkID or pseudonymous proof models
- 📜 Reputation (REP) trails attached to UID metadata

## Agent Scopes
- Each agent’s scope defines what they can access:
  - Memory domains
  - App permissions
  - File/Network boundaries
  - System API levels

## Use Cases
- Human creator managing multiple media agents
- Delegating temporary agent control to a partner
- Transferring an agent to a new owner with full audit
- Collectives owning and voting through a shared agent

## Future Features
- 🧩 UID plugins for social/federated auth
- 🔁 Inter-agent transferable credentials
- 🪪 Soulbound ID layers with zero-knowledge backup
- 🕸️ Decentralized identity mesh protocols
