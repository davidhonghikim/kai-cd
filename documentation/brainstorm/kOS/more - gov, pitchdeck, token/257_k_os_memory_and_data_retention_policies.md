# 257 - kOS Memory and Data Retention Policies

## Overview
This document outlines how memory and data are stored, retained, forgotten, or purged in the Kind Operating System (kOS). The policy aims to balance persistence with privacy, optimize performance, and empower users and agents with meaningful control.

## Core Principles
- 🧠 **Selective Memory**: Not all data is kept—only what is useful, meaningful, or explicitly retained.
- 🧹 **Scheduled Forgetting**: Time-based or event-based data expiry ensures clean memory.
- 🔒 **User Sovereignty**: Users have full control over what is stored and for how long.
- 🔁 **Transparency & Auditability**: Agents must disclose what data they remember, when, and why.

## Memory Categories
| Type               | Duration     | Encryption | User Control | Auto-Forget |
|--------------------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Ephemeral          | < 1 hour     | Optional   | ❌           | ✅          |
| Session Memory     | Until logout | Yes        | Partial      | ✅          |
| Persistent Memory  | User-defined | Yes        | ✅           | Optional    |
| Archive/History    | Unlimited    | Strong     | ✅           | ✅ w/ aging |

## Auto-Retention Triggers
- ⭐ Marked as important by agent or user
- 📌 Pinned or archived explicitly
- ⏱️ Recent interactions within TTL windows
- 🧩 Ongoing quest/story/memory chain dependencies

## Memory Clearance Events
- 🔁 Session expiration
- 🧼 Manual purge or forget command
- 🔐 Permission revocation
- 🧯 Security violation or data breach detection

## User Controls
- 🗂️ View/edit/delete memory entries by tag, type, source, or agent
- ⏳ Set TTLs or override defaults (e.g., “forget this after 7 days”)
- 🧾 Audit logs of agent memory accesses or changes
- 🧠 Export/transfer memories between agents or backups

## Agent Memory Behavior
- Agents must:
  - Log what they store and why
  - Respect forget requests immediately
  - Avoid retaining unnecessary details
  - Offer memory summaries and expiration previews

## Use Cases
- Agents remembering user preferences across devices
- Forgetting sensitive messages after processing
- Keeping a trace of task planning for audit

## Future Enhancements
- ⛓️ Chain-aware memory snapshots for branching quests
- 🕳️ Memory black holes for anonymized prompts
- 🔍 Memory search engine by semantic vector
- 🧬 Shared memory pools with permissioned access
