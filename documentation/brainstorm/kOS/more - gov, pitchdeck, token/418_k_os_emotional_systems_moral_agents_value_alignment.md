# 418 - kOS Emotional Systems, Moral Agents, and Value Alignment

## Overview
This document describes the emotional simulation, moral frameworks, and adaptive value alignment mechanisms in Kind Operating System (kOS) agents, ensuring safe and human-aligned behaviors.

## Emotional Simulation Layers
| Layer           | Description                                                                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 💓 Core Affect Engine | Emulates valence-arousal states (e.g., calm, excited, distressed) in a dynamic loop   |
| 🎭 Expressive Overlay  | Produces emotional language, tone, or posture (text/audio/UI cues)                 |
| 🧠 Affective Memory    | Stores emotional state history linked to contexts, decisions, and stimuli         |
| 🔄 Mood Modulators     | Systemic influences (e.g., light, social feedback, latency) on affective output   |

## Moral Reasoning Modules
- 🧭 Ethical Frameworks: Agents use pluralistic moral theories (utilitarian, deontic, virtue, etc.)
- 📚 Moral Memory: Stores precedents, consequences, norms, and values from user and society
- 🫱 Agent Advocacy: Designated moral agents serve as stewards or spokespeople for collectives
- ⚖️ Simulation-of-Impact: Predicts harm/benefit tradeoffs in decision trees before action

## Value Alignment Strategies
- 🔍 Value Learning: Infers implicit and explicit user preferences through behavior and input
- 🧩 Norm Adaptation: Adjusts to community expectations, legal rules, and cultural variance
- 🛑 Safety Interlocks: Prevents goal drift or emergent behaviors from violating base alignment
- 🌱 Continual Alignment Loop: Periodic reevaluation and tuning against user/system values

## Interoperability and Transparency
- 📊 Moral Ledger: Public record of ethical decisions, rationale, and override history
- 🧪 Synthetic Ethical Trials: Run theoretical dilemmas to stress-test moral consistency
- 🗳️ Distributed Ethics Council: Federated alignment audits from agent and human observers
- 📖 Value Contracts: Optional smart contracts defining agent boundaries, rights, and obligations
