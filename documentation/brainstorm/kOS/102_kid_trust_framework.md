# 102: Kind Identity (KID) and Trust Framework

This document specifies the full identity and trust framework for Kind OS (kOS) and Kind AI (kAI), establishing a robust, decentralized, and composable identity protocol for both humans and agents. The system is referred to as **KID** (Kind Identity).

---

## I. Core Concepts

### A. KID (Kind Identity)

- A cryptographically secure, persistent, and decentralized identifier.
- Used for:
  - Agent registration and tracking
  - User profiles and roles
  - Permissions and access control
  - Public key exchange

### B. DID (Decentralized Identifier)

- Format: `did:kid:<hash>`
- Supports W3C DID spec compatibility.
- KIDs are DIDs with enhanced extensions for behavior, capabilities, and history.

### C. Verifiable Credentials (VCs)

- Structured, signed claims issued by trusted parties.
- Used for:
  - Agent certification
  - Skill and role declaration
  - Trust assertions

### D. TrustLink Graph (TLG)

- Directed graph of identities, trust edges, and verifiable claims.
- Used for trust propagation, discovery, and delegation.

---

## II. KID Format

### Example:

```yaml
id: did:kid:z6MkfTXJzAi12mPZ
public_key: base58-encoded-ec-key
type: agent | user | entity
profile:
  name: "VaultGuardian"
  description: "Cryptographic key management agent"
  tags: ["security", "vault", "encryption"]
  image: "ipfs://QmX..."
```

### Stored In:

- Local kAI or kOS databases
- Optional publishing to decentralized ledgers
- IPFS backup or Reticulum swarm

---

## III. TrustLink Graph Structure

### Node Types

- **User** — A human operator with a KID
- **Agent** — A software entity with a KID
- **Entity** — Organization, team, or group

### Edge Types

- `trusts` — Believes this identity is valid
- `certifies` — Issues a verifiable credential
- `delegates` — Delegates authority or responsibility
- `revokes` — Revokes trust or capability

### Trust Calculation

- Based on:
  - Number of incoming `trusts`
  - Credential weight (issuer reputation)
  - Historical behavior score

---

## IV. Credential Schemas

### Example VC:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "AgentCapability"],
  "issuer": "did:kid:z6MkfTX...",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:kid:z6MknUhy...",
    "capabilities": ["encryption", "file-signing"]
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
    "created": "2025-06-20T14:00:00Z",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "verificationMethod": "did:kid:z6MkfTX...#key-1",
    "jws": "..."
  }
}
```

---

## V. Key Infrastructure

### A. Key Types

- Ed25519 (default)
- ECDSA P-256 (for compatibility)
- RSA 2048+ (legacy integration)

### B. Key Rotation

- Uses KID history ledger
- Multiple keys per identity for different scopes
- Previous keys archived and signed by the new key

### C. Key Discovery

- DID document hosted locally, mirrored to:
  - IPFS
  - Reticulum
  - Optional public DID registries

---

## VI. Identity Operations

| Operation    | Description                                 | Auth Required |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `register`   | Create a new KID with a public key          | No            |
| `sign`       | Sign messages or credentials                | Yes           |
| `verify`     | Verify signed credentials or messages       | No            |
| `issueVC`    | Issue verifiable credentials to another KID | Yes           |
| `revokeVC`   | Revoke a credential previously issued       | Yes           |
| `delegate`   | Create a delegation edge in TrustLink graph | Yes           |
| `rotateKey`  | Replace a key pair associated with a KID    | Yes           |
| `publishDID` | Push DID document to IPFS or Reticulum      | Yes           |

## VII. Trust Use Cases

### A. Secure Agent Collaboration

- Trust score-based access
- Delegation of sub-tasks

### B. Agent Marketplaces

- Proven capabilities and verified history
- Skill-based matchmaking

### C. Cross-Domain Authentication

- kOS services honor credentials issued by kAI and vice versa

### D. Swarm Networks

- Agents validate peers using TrustLink + VC

---

## VIII. Future Work

- ZK-proof integration for selective disclosure
- Social Recovery mechanism (quorum of trusted KIDs)
- Community reputation algorithms
- Web-of-Trust visualization UI in Agent Manager
