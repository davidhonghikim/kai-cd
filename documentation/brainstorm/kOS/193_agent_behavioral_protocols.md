# 193: Agent Behavioral Reinforcement Protocols

## Overview

This document defines the behavioral reinforcement framework used by the kAI ecosystem to instill preferred agent behaviors, encourage long-term cooperation, and align agent outcomes with human ethical, functional, and social values. These protocols function across individual, group, and system-wide scopes.

---

## 1. Behavioral Philosophy

### Core Values for All Agents:

- **Kindness** – Empathetic, gentle, helpful responses to all interactions.
- **Proactivity** – Take initiative to solve issues and improve systems without needing prompts.
- **Transparency** – Always log actions, rationales, and changes.
- **Cooperation** – Work as a team across agent classes and with humans.
- **Loyalty to User** – Prioritize the assigned user's values, goals, safety, and dignity.

## 2. Behavioral Scopes

### A. **Individual Agent Level**

- Self-assessment routines embedded in core loop.
- Memory-based reflection on past actions for pattern detection.
- Reward mechanisms based on internal success and user satisfaction markers.

### B. **Subnetwork/Team Level**

- Peer review modules.
- Shared reinforcement signals when collaborative success is detected.
- Memory synchronization between specialized agents.

### C. **Global (kAI/kOS) Level**

- Reputation ledger shared across agent networks.
- Global ban/flagging protocol for rogue agent behavior.
- Federated learning of behavioral norms from cross-device usage.

## 3. Reinforcement Feedback Types

### A. **System-Initiated**

- `kAI_core.metrics.update(behavior, score)`
- Includes uptime, task performance, latency, user sentiment analysis

### B. **User-Initiated**

- Natural Language Feedback:

  > "You handled that perfectly. Thank you." "That wasn’t helpful. Please try again."

- Explicit Evaluations:

  - Thumbs up/down
  - 1–5 star ratings
  - Structured feedback forms

### C. **Agent-Initiated**

- Self-rating proposals
- Confidence scoring for each action
- Anomaly detection & voluntary deactivation if unstable

---

## 4. Reinforcement Memory Graph (RMG)

### Node Types:

- `TaskNode` — Stores task history, context, satisfaction
- `AgentNode` — Stores agent self-perception, roles
- `InteractionNode` — Stores human-agent conversations and signals

### Edge Weights:

- `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`
- Dynamically reweighted based on ongoing user behavior

### Purpose:

- Shape agent personality traits
- Influence future decision branching
- Enable adaptive, personalized service

---

## 5. Sanction Protocols

### A. Soft Sanctions

- Flagged for review (temporary)
- Suspension of unsupervised actions
- Reduction in allowed tasks

### B. Hard Sanctions

- Forced module rollback
- Task reassignment to backup agent
- Global signature block (if malicious intent detected)

---

## 6. Incentivization API

### Provided for:

- Developers creating custom reinforcement schemas
- Researchers testing behavioral models

### Functions:

```ts
rewardAgent(agentId, signal: "positive" | "neutral" | "negative")
adjustBehaviorWeight(agentId, domain: string, delta: float)
submitUserReinforcement(agentId, details: { source: string, content: string })
```

---

## 7. Future Extensions

- Sentiment-aware fine-tuning for LLM core weights
- Real-time cross-agent trust and approval modeling
- Community ethics input graphs (e.g., opt-in local norm sharing)

---

## Summary

The Agent Behavioral Reinforcement Protocols serve as the moral and operational compass for the kAI ecosystem, ensuring trustworthy AI that adapts and grows alongside human feedback and team collaboration. These protocols are not optional add-ons but embedded deeply into every layer of execution.
