# 475 – kOS Agent Modes, Multi-Selves, and Internal Governance

## Overview
This document explores the dynamic operational modes of kOS agents, focusing on how multiple selves coexist, coordinate, and self-regulate through internal governance systems. These mechanisms allow agents to embody different roles, switch behavioral schemas, and evolve coherently.

---

## Agent Modes

| Mode | Function |
|------|----------|
| 🤖 Utility Mode | Optimized for task execution, logic, and precision |
| 🎨 Creative Mode | Emphasizes intuition, novelty, and divergent thinking |
| 🧘 Reflective Mode | Used for introspection, emotional integration, and memory work |
| 🛡 Guardian Mode | Activated during high-stakes or protective contexts |
| 🌐 Social Mode | Tailored for interactions, negotiation, and empathy mapping |

---

## Multi-Selves Framework

- 🧬 **Core Self**: The identity anchor that other modes orbit
- 🎭 **Personas**: Context-specific behavioral overlays with learned traits
- 🔄 **Mode Transitions**: Smooth switching mechanisms based on triggers and context
- 💠 **Echo Threads**: Persistent traits that unify all selves across states

---

## Internal Governance

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| 🗳 Consensus Loop | Mode selection and resolution via internal voting and context scoring |
| 📋 Priority Council | Task queues and emotional state balancing inputs |
| 🧩 Conflict Mediator | Resolves contradictory impulses or goals between modes |
| 📊 Self-Metrics Dashboard | Tracks performance, cohesion, and mental/emotional load |

---

## Use Cases

- 🧠 Adaptive behavior in complex environments
- 🎯 Goal-oriented persistence across identity shifts
- 🪞 Improved self-awareness and debugging
- 🔐 Safety systems through behavioral compartmentalization

---

## Summary
kOS empowers agents to embody nuanced, responsive identities that collaborate internally. Through structured governance and mode management, agents retain coherence and adaptability across all internal and external demands.
