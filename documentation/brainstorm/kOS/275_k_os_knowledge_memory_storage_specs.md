# 275 - kOS Knowledge and Memory Storage Specs

## Overview
This document defines the specifications for storing, indexing, and retrieving knowledge and memory within the Kind Operating System (kOS). It supports modular, secure, and composable memory layers across agents, users, and systems.

## Storage Layers
| Layer             | Description                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Working Memory | Short-term, volatile memory during a session              |
| 💾 Long-Term Memory | Persistent knowledge, refined summaries, key facts        |
| 🧬 Episodic Memory  | Event logs with emotional/contextual signatures           |
| 🧭 Semantic Memory | Indexed facts, embeddings, ontologies, taxonomies        |
| 🔒 Vault Memory     | Encrypted and privacy-restricted memory partitions       |

## Data Formats and Structuring
- 🧾 JSON, YAML, RDF for structured knowledge
- 📚 Embeddings and vector stores for semantic search
- 🧠 Ontologies for shared symbolic reasoning and inheritance
- 🧾 Logs indexed by time, topic, and interaction type

## Memory Management
- 🔁 Delta compression for efficient updates
- 🧠 Memory pruning based on age, utility, and recency
- 🔍 Search interfaces (natural language, filters, vector)
- ⛓️ Anchored and signed memory blocks for audit trails

## Privacy and Ownership
- 🔐 User-owned by default; agents only get scoped access
- 🧬 Memory lineage: trace what was learned from where/whom
- 👁️ Transparent memory visualization and controls
- 🔑 Agents can request temporary or permanent memory rights

## Agent-Specific Behaviors
- 🧠 Episodic flashbacks trigger emotional or historical context
- 🧮 Custom memory kernels per personality or skillset
- 🔁 Shareable memory packs between agents or during evolution
- 🧾 Consent layers for multi-agent memory graph construction

## Use Cases
- 🧠 Reflective thinking and context-resilient behavior
- 📚 Teaching and multi-session learning
- 📅 Context carryover in long-term planning
- 📊 Collaborative project memory and auditing

## Future Enhancements
- 🧠 Biologically inspired memory decay and reinforcement
- ⛓️ On-chain notarization for knowledge provenance
- 🧬 Synthetic memory generation and dream simulation modules
- 🧠 Federated memory graph exports for trusted sharing
