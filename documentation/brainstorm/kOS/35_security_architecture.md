# 35: Security Architecture and Trust Layers (kAI / kOS)

This document defines the comprehensive security architecture for both kAI (Kind AI) and kOS (Kind Operating System). It specifies protocols, identity management, encryption standards, sandboxing strategies, and zero-trust enforcement.

---

## I. Threat Model Overview

### Primary Threat Vectors
- Unauthorized agent impersonation
- Malicious user injection via third-party services
- Cross-agent data leakage
- Plugin supply-chain compromise
- Browser extension privilege escalation

### Security Goals
- Isolate agents and plugins
- End-to-end encryption for all inter-agent messages
- Role-based access control and fine-grained permissions
- Auditability of all sensitive operations
- Secure by default; no weak defaults

---

## II. Identity and Cryptographic Infrastructure

### A. Agent Identity
- Every agent instance generates an Ed25519 keypair on first launch
- Agent public keys are registered with the Agent Registry (local + remote federated KLP-compatible)
- Agents must sign all outbound MAP messages with their private key

### B. User Identity
- Each user profile includes a unique DID (Decentralized Identifier)
- kOS supports WebAuthn, passwordless login, and 2FA (TOTP + biometric optional)

### C. Encryption Standards
- Asymmetric: Ed25519, Curve25519 (for X25519 key exchange)
- Symmetric: AES-256-GCM for encrypted storage and session memory
- Hashing: SHA-512, BLAKE3
- Key Derivation: PBKDF2 (200k rounds, SHA-512), Argon2id (future)

---

## III. Secure Agent Execution

### A. Sandboxing Strategies
| Environment | Method |
|------------|--------|
| Browser     | Chrome Extension manifest v3 + Service Workers + iframes
| Node.js     | vm2 sandbox + nsjail (optional containerization)
| Embedded    | WASM with restricted imports

### B. Permissions Model
- Agents declare capabilities via MAP handshake
- System performs capability + signature check before routing
- Permissions config stored in `permissions.json`, editable by root user

---

## IV. Vault and Secrets Management

### A. kVault Service
- Local-only AES-256-GCM encrypted vault
- UI-integrated secure input
- Auto-lock on inactivity or sleep
- Supports structured secrets: API tokens, JWTs, credentials, PGP keys

### B. Environment Key Separation
- Separate keyrings per environment (dev, staging, prod)
- Master keys stored via user password + derived key

---

## V. Inter-Agent Communication (Secure MAP)

### A. Signed Messaging
- Every MAP message must include Ed25519 signature
- Message signature verified by recipient agent before processing

### B. Replay Protection
- MAP IDs timestamped, checked for drift (<30s)
- Nonce cache (LRU, in memory) prevents reuse

### C. Encrypted Channels
- Optional payload-level X25519 shared-key exchange for E2EE
- MQTT/Redis communications tunnelled via TLS v1.3

---

## VI. System-Level Hardening

### A. kOS Kernel Policies
- Root user permission model for installing agents and accessing core config
- Secure boot with checksum validation for all binaries
- Mandatory logging for all agent install/uninstall operations

### B. Update System
- Signed manifest update files
- SHA-256 file integrity check before replacement
- Optional auto-update w/ review step in enterprise mode

---

## VII. Trust Management (Trust Graph + Federation)

### A. Trust Levels
- `trusted` – can initiate workflows, access user PII
- `partner` – can collaborate, needs permission for sensitive data
- `external` – isolated by default, sandboxed, read-only

### B. Trust Propagation
- Trust Graph maintained in kGraph module
- Propagates transitive trust with tunable depth (default: 2)
- Revocation lists auto-synced from federation nodes

### C. Federated Trust Sharing
- Compatible with KLP (Kind Link Protocol)
- Trust exchange via signed profiles
- Peer verification + manual override

---

## VIII. Audit and Logging

### A. kLog – Secure Audit Log
- Append-only, immutable format (Merkle chain-based)
- Includes:
  - Agent launches & exits
  - System modifications
  - Vault access
  - Contract handshakes
- Stored locally + remote mirror if federated

### B. User Alerts
- Real-time toast + feed notifications for suspicious actions
- Customizable security alert thresholds

---

## IX. Recovery and Emergency Access

### A. Recovery Modes
- Encrypted recovery key split into Shamir shares (default 3-of-5)
- Biometric + OTP fallback (optional)
- Offline unlock CLI for headless restore

### B. Emergency Destruction
- `kKillSwitch` script:
  - Secure vault wipe
  - Agent keypair destruction
  - App self-destruct (removal)
  - Secure zero-out of temp/cache files
