# 166: KLP Governance Stack ‚Äì Protocols, Layers & Interop

This document specifies the entire governance architecture, trust protocol, and interoperability layer stack for the **Kind Link Protocol (KLP)** within the kAI/kOS ecosystem. It enables secure, federated, modular cooperation between agents, services, systems, and users.

---

## I. Overview

**KLP (Kind Link Protocol)** is the primary interoperability and governance standard of the Kind ecosystem. It ensures:

- Secure, verifiable identity exchange
- Inter-agent and inter-system communication
- Decentralized, modular governance
- Reputation-based trust architecture
- Federated observability, auditing, and accountability

KLP powers everything from individual user config sync to enterprise-grade federated agent negotiations.

---

## II. Layered Protocol Stack

### A. Layer 0: Identity & Signing

- **DID / KID (Kind Identity Descriptor):** Self-sovereign identity format, extends W3C DID.
- **Signature Algorithms:** Ed25519 (default), ECDSA (optional).
- **Public Key Exchange:** Uses in-band signed metadata envelope (via KLP message).
- **Onboarding:** One-time keygen + signed attestation with optionally verified email / domain / org linkage.

### B. Layer 1: KLP Messaging Envelope

- Encrypted & signed JSON blob (JWE + JWS)
- Contains headers:
  - `sender_id`, `receiver_id`
  - `nonce`, `timestamp`, `session_id`
  - `capability_scope`, `authz_level`
- Payload types:
  - `agent_announce`, `contract_propose`, `trust_update`, `state_patch`, `governance_vote`
  - Custom app-payloads: `task_request`, `data_offer`, `proof_submission`

### C. Layer 2: Capability Registry

- Defines what an agent or system **can do** under its current trust profile.
- Modeled via **KCR (Kind Capability Record)** objects:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "agent.kai.045",
    "capabilities": ["read.chroma", "write.prompts", "initiate.session"],
    "delegated_by": "user.kos.001",
    "trust_level": 4
  }
  ```
- Synced and updated via signed `capability_patch` messages.

### D. Layer 3: Trust Layer & Reputation Ledger

- Every identity accrues a **reputation graph**:
  - `trust_score`: dynamic integer (0‚Äì1000)
  - `reviews`: structured peer reviews
  - `feedback`: signed attestations
- Time-decayed weighting (recent trust counts more)
- Agents may **query**, **filter**, and **negotiate** access based on trust context.

### E. Layer 4: Governance Channels

- Each `KLP::Channel` represents a governed scope:
  - `global.network`, `region.eu-west`, `org.acme`, `project.kosmos`, `agent.kai001`
- Each has:
  - `Members` (signed join + trust quorum)
  - `Votes` (time-limited, weighted by trust)
  - `Ruleset` (signed, versioned JSON schema)
  - `Moderator Agent` (enforces policies, triggers audits)

---

## III. Integration with kAI / kOS

### A. Agent Trust Bootstrap

- On first install, agent issues `announce` with its signed metadata
- Receives trust patch + capabilities from user or admin agent

### B. Session Identity Propagation

- All inter-agent messages use short-lived `session_id`
- Propagates scoped credential context (e.g., prompt executor, media fetcher)

### C. Governance Hooks

- Every major action (e.g., external API access, sensitive data handling) is:
  - Logged to audit trail
  - Broadcast to `governance_channel` if escalated

### D. Secure UI Trust Indicators

- Visual labels (üîê Trusted | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unknown | üö´ Blocked)
- User-customizable trust score thresholds

---

## IV. Interop & External Standards

### A. Compatibility

- **DIDComm v2**
- **ActivityPub + FedCM** (identity relays)
- **OAuth2/OIDC token relay into KLP session**
- **Matrix** federation fallback possible

### B. Conversion & Routing

- Gateways available for:
  - Legacy REST systems (via capability shim)
  - Webhooks (via inbound KLP translation)
  - JSON-RPC and gRPC stubs auto-generated from capability registry

---

## V. CLI + Agent Library Support

### A. `klpctl` CLI Tool

- `klpctl identity create`
- `klpctl capability grant --agent xyz`
- `klpctl trust audit --channel org.myproject`

### B. Libraries

- **Python**: `klp-py`
- **Node.js**: `klp-js`
- **Rust**: `klp-core`

All libraries support envelope creation, signature handling, trust score computation, and capability enforcement.

---

## VI. Security & Privacy

- Full auditability of agent actions
- Signed + encrypted communications only
- Per-message TTL + scope validation
- No default trust escalation (explicit delegation only)

---

## VII. Example: Governance Proposal

```json
{
  "type": "governance_vote",
  "channel": "org.kai",
  "proposal": {
    "id": "vote123",
    "action": "require_2fa",
    "description": "All new agents must verify with TOTP",
    "options": ["yes", "no", "abstain"],
    "created_by": "agent.kai001",
    "expires_at": "2025-06-30T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

---

## VIII. Future Enhancements

- Zero-knowledge trust attestations
- Multi-sig agent action approval
- Distributed Merkle chain for audit trail
- Agent behavior modeling & anomaly alerts
