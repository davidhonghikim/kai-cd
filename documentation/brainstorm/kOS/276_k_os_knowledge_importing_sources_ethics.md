# 276 - kOS Knowledge Importing, Sources, and Ethical Use

## Overview
This document outlines how external knowledge is brought into the kOS ecosystem, how source trustworthiness is determined, and how ethical constraints guide knowledge usage, attribution, and moderation.

## Knowledge Import Channels
| Channel             | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 🌐 Web Crawlers       | Indexed and filtered content from trusted sites  |
| 🤝 Human Uploads      | User-submitted articles, data, or media          |
| 🔌 API Connectors     | Integrations with external services and feeds    |
| 📡 Sensor Streams     | Real-world data from IoT, wearables, cameras     |

## Source Evaluation
- 🏷️ Tagged by source type, authority, recency, and reliability
- 🔍 Fact-checked against multiple canonical or expert sources
- 🧠 Scored dynamically by community trust and system validators
- 📜 Metadata tracked for every imported knowledge object

## Attribution and Licensing
- 📚 Original authors and creators are preserved and credited
- 🔐 Licensing metadata respects copyrights and fair use
- 🧾 Immutable logs store attribution chains and usage paths
- 🔍 Attribution links shown during usage or re-surfacing

## Ethical Constraints
- ❌ No imports from deceptive, manipulative, or malicious actors
- 🚫 Content marked as hate speech, disinfo, or abuse is filtered
- 🤖 AI-generated sources are labeled and evaluated separately
- 🔍 Transparent flags for controversial or disputed material

## Moderation and Oversight
- 🧑‍⚖️ Review committees can issue override votes
- 🧠 Guilds curate knowledge per domain (science, law, arts)
- 🗳️ Disputes settled via community or DAO-based voting
- 📈 Transparency dashboards for trust level and source influence

## Use Cases
- 📚 Teaching agents trained only on verifiable, ethical content
- 🧪 Scientific research backed by source traceability
- 🧭 Personalized news or learning from curated, trusted streams
- 📜 Content moderation assisted by transparent sourcing

## Future Enhancements
- 🧠 Memory-based provenance audit trails
- 🛡️ Bias detection engines and counter-balance injectors
- 🧬 Dynamic trust graph that evolves with validation feedback
- 🔏 Smart license enforcement for digital assets and data
