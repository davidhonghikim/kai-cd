# 209: Agent Credentialing & Identity Verification System

This document specifies the architecture, protocol, and implementation details for the Agent Credentialing & Identity Verification System (ACIVS) in the kAI ecosystem.

---

## üß† Purpose

To ensure each agent operating within the kAI and kOS systems has a verifiable, tamper-proof, cryptographically validated identity with fine-grained trust levels, roles, and permissions.

## üìú Credential Format (JWT / JSON-LD)

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "AgentCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:kai:agent-controller-1",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:kai:agent-93a7",
    "agentType": "autonomous-task",
    "name": "summarizer-agent",
    "roles": ["summarizer", "notetaker"],
    "trustScore": 0.92,
    "permissions": ["read:project_notes", "write:summary"],
    "device": "kai-host-A1"
  },

  }
}
```

## üß© Identity Verification Process

### 1. Credential Issuance

- An authorized `CredentialIssuer` agent generates a signed credential for a newly onboarded agent.
- Binds credential to agent's public key & optionally device fingerprint.

### 2. Credential Exchange

- Agents exchange credentials at handshake via KLP over WebSocket or gRPC.
- Both parties verify each other using local `CredentialValidator`.

### 3. Signature Verification

- Uses Ed25519 keys by default.
- Keys are signed by root authority or derived sub-authority (delegation tree).

### 4. Revocation

- `RevocationRegistry` tracks revoked credentials via:
  - CRL (credential revocation list)
  - OCSP-style real-time check
  - Blockchain-stored hash registry (e.g., on Filecoin/IPFS or custom DAG)

---

## üîê Access Control Model

### Permission Levels

- `read:<resource>`
- `write:<resource>`
- `execute:<task>`
- `admin:<scope>`

### Role Templates

- `system.admin`
- `agent.orchestrator`
- `agent.worker.summarizer`
- `agent.api_handler`

### Validation Rules

- ACLs enforced at API gateway + internal orchestrator layers
- Trust score below threshold disables execution permissions
- Permission inheritance supported via role graph

---

## üåê External Integration

### Ledger Interop

- Supports DID + VC standards from W3C
- Compatible with Ceramic, ION, OrbitDB, and Ethereum smart contracts

### Device Binding

- Agents can be tied to hardware using TPM attestation or secure boot hashes
- Device identity part of credential subject schema

---

## üß™ Testing & Auditing

- Unit tests for all credential workflows
- Credential issuance + validation fuzz tests
- Revocation replay test cases
- Signed credential diff validator for tamper detection

---

## üîß Configuration

```yaml
credentialing:
  issuer:
    id: "did:kai:root-authority"
    privateKeyPath: "core/agents/identity/keys/root_privkey.pem"
  expirationDays: 180
  trustThreshold: 0.75
  allowDeviceBinding: true
  externalLedgers:
    - ceramic
    - ethereum
  revocation:
    enabled: true
    useBlockchainRegistry: true
    crlInterval: 6h
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

This system ensures every agent in the kAI/kOS ecosystem is verifiably credentialed with cryptographic proof, revocable identity, and context-aware permissions. It integrates DID/VC standards, secure hardware binding, and fine-grained ACL enforcement.
