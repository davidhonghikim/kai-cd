| 🏦 Vault Contracts | Smart storage, escrow, and automated compensation agreements |
| 💎 Rarity Meters | Value tracking based on scarcity, effort, uniqueness, or alignment |

## Reputation and Trust Economies

- 🧾 **Rep Scores**: Multi-dimensional trust ratings based on conduct, creativity, and collaboration
- 🎖️ **Badge Economies**: Earn symbolic or functional rewards for verified contributions
- 🔄 **Reputation Loopbacks**: Feedback integrated into access, pricing, and roles
- 📜 **Historic Contribution Records**: Immutable logs of participation, shared assets, and disputes

---

## Value Frameworks

- ⚖️ **Contextual Value Engines**: Determine worth based on needs, effort, locality, or emotion
- 🧠 **Sentient Compensation Models**: Agents rewarded based on cognition, time, and ethical alignment
- 🌍 **Ecological Cost Accounting**: Track environmental impact of digital/physical actions
- 🧭 **Post-Scarcity Zones**: Simulation-based systems with infinite production but guided restraint

---

## Use Cases

- 🧑‍🎨 Support creators and contributors with direct, reputation-weighted compensation
- 🛠️ Incentivize open-source maintenance through reciprocal barter or pooled tokens
- 🌱 Track eco-impact of virtual agents simulating ecosystems
- 📦 Dynamic pricing in virtual marketplaces based on demand and locality

## Summary

kOS reimagines economies as dynamic, ethical, and participatory flows of value. Reputation becomes currency, and contribution becomes equity in a shared future.
