# 47: Agent Security Models and Sandboxing

This document defines the layered security model for agents within kAI (Kind AI) and kOS (Kind OS), focusing on sandboxing mechanisms, access control, secure communication, capability delegation, and containment of potential hostile behavior.

---

## I. Purpose

Establish a security framework for executing autonomous and semi-autonomous agents safely, while preserving interoperability and composability within the kAI/kOS ecosystem.

---

## II. Directory Structure

```text
src/
└── security/
    ├── AgentSandbox.ts             # Sandbox execution manager
    ├── PermissionsManager.ts       # Role-based and capability-based permission system
    ├── CapabilityDelegation.ts     # Fine-grained delegation and inheritance
    ├── SecureMessageChannel.ts     # Message encryption and validation
    ├── ThreatDetectionEngine.ts    # Runtime anomaly monitoring
    └── audit/
        ├── ExecutionTraceLogger.ts # Log all sandboxed agent executions
        └── SecurityAlertEmitter.ts # Emits system-wide alerts for violations
```

---

## III. Sandboxing Engine

Agents are run in isolated environments with tight constraints, depending on trust level.

### A. Techniques Used

- **VM-based Sandboxing:** Using Python `restrictedexec`, `multiprocessing` with read-only memory mounts
- **nsjail or gVisor integration** (configurable at runtime)
- **Time-based, memory-based, syscall-based caps**
- **Read-only FS and temp storage zones**

### B. Levels of Isolation

| Trust Score | Sandbox Profile                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| > 0.85      | Minimal isolation (trusted)           |
| 0.5 - 0.85  | Standard sandbox (default)            |
| < 0.5       | Quarantine profile (severely limited) |

---

## IV. Permission and Role Matrix

Permission structure is enforced using role-capability-token tuples.

```ts
interface AgentRole {
  id: string;
  permissions: string[]; // e.g., 'read:file', 'write:cache', 'spawn:worker'
  inherits?: string[];   // Supports role composition
}
```

### Sample Roles

```json
{
  "translator": ["read:input", "write:output"],
  "orchestrator": ["spawn:worker", "read:agents", "write:memory"],
  "auditor": ["read:log", "read:config"]
}
```

---

## V. Capability Delegation

Trusted agents can delegate scoped capabilities to other agents via signed envelopes.

```ts
interface DelegationEnvelope {
  issuer: AgentIdentity;
  recipient: AgentIdentity;
  capabilities: string[];
  expiry: string;  // ISO8601
  signature: string;
}
```

Includes optional constraints:

- **Context** (only during specific operations)
- **Time-bound or usage-bound**
- **Revocation endpoint**

---

## VI. Secure Communication

### A. Channels

- All inter-agent communication uses `SecureMessageChannel`
- End-to-end encryption (E2EE) via Ed25519 or X25519
- Optionally signed payloads with hash-locked verification

### B. Anti-Tampering

- HMAC for internal bus messages
- Encrypted logs to verify integrity (via `ExecutionTraceLogger`)

---

## VII. Threat Detection

Agents are monitored in near-real-time for:

- Excessive CPU/RAM usage
- Anomalous loop detection
- Invalid requests or I/O
- Behavior drift vs baseline (future ML model)

Triggers:

- `security-alert` event
- `quarantine-agent(agentId)`
- Optional: Admin notification or auto-block

---

## VIII. Audit and Alerting

### ExecutionTraceLogger

- Logs syscall, IO patterns, data footprint
- Encrypted, time-stamped
- Rotated hourly or size-based

### SecurityAlertEmitter

- Emits structured alerts
- Broadcasts to orchestration bus and optional admin dashboard

---

## IX. Integration with Trust Protocols

Sandbox level and capability are dynamically linked to Trust Score (see Doc 45).

Actions that impact Trust Score:

- Violation of boundaries
- Tampering or escalation attempts
- Repeated invocation of restricted APIs

---

## X. Roadmap

| Feature                                 | Version |
| --------------------------------------- | ------- |
| AI-assisted syscall pattern model       | v1.2    |
| Agent self-isolation recommendations    | v1.3    |
| Remote attestation of sandbox integrity | v2.0    |
| zkPoW resource proofs for execution     | v2.2    |

---

This system ensures all agents operate under cryptographically auditable, behavior-constrained, and runtime-verifiable security envelopes.
