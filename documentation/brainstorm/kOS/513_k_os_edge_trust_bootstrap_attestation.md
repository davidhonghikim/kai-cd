# kOS Edge Trust & Bootstrap Attestation Protocols

## Overview
This document defines the procedures and mechanisms for establishing initial trust at the edge of the network in the Kind Operating System (kOS). It introduces trust bootstrap strategies, attestation workflows, and verification paths to ensure that new agents, nodes, or devices joining the swarm can be verified and safely integrated into distributed operations.

---

## Core Goals
- Ensure new participants are verified, trustworthy, and policy-aligned before being granted operational access
- Enable decentralized, layered trust establishment with minimal central dependency
- Provide cryptographic and behavioral attestation options
- Defend against spoofing, impersonation, or rogue actor infiltration at the edge

---

## 1. Trust Bootstrap Sequence
### üß¨ Initialization
- Device or agent generates ephemeral keypair and boot hash
- Declares intention to join via signed Join Request Packet (JRP)
- Includes minimal metadata: role intent, capabilities, origin

### üìú Verification Phases
1. **Self-Integrity Check**: Performs internal hardware/software hash attestations
2. **Known Entity Sponsor**: Optional trust bridge from known swarm node (cosigned JRP)
3. **Challenge-Response**: Guardian agent triggers cryptographic, behavioral, or task-based challenge

---

## 2. Attestation Types
### üîê Hardware-Level Attestation
- TPM-based or cryptographic co-processor root of trust
- Hash measurements of firmware, bootloader, kernel

### üß† Behavioral Attestation
- Simulated test environment
- Metrics include:
  - Latency to swarm signals
  - Conformance to expected norms
  - Meta-pattern matching against known good/bad agents

### üßæ Historical Lineage Verification
- Swarm-stored metadata chains
- Proof of prior swarm activity or upstream mentorship

---

## 3. Trust Scoring & Thresholds
- Multi-parameter score:
  - Hardware integrity
  - Software signature lineage
  - Sponsorship strength
  - Behavioral alignment
- Minimum score threshold varies by task class (e.g. sensory node vs. data guardian)

---

## 4. Revocation and Reevaluation
- Continuous trust revalidation window
- Guardian agents may trigger full re-attestation upon anomaly detection
- Revoked agents quarantined in swarm shadowspace for observation

---

## 5. Example Use Cases
- New solar-powered field node initiates trust bootstrap via local peer sponsor
- Rogue firmware detected via boot hash mismatch ‚Üí blocked at attestation
- Agent with expired lineage triggers automatic reevaluation workflow

---

## Future Integrations
- Zero-knowledge proof attestations for anonymized trust admission
- Trust token portability across mesh networks
- Integration with 514_kOS_Mesh_Networking_Peer_Consensus.md
