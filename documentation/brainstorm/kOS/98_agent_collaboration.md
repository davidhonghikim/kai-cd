# 98: Agent Collaboration Models

This document defines all collaborative structures, protocols, and behaviors for how agents in the `kAI` and `kOS` ecosystems can work together across environments, runtimes, and use cases.

---

## I. Overview

Agent collaboration is a foundational capability in `kOS`. It enables:

- Distributed decision-making
- Task parallelization
- Trust-based delegation
- Resilient fallback operations
- Cross-domain computation

---

## II. Collaboration Modes

### A. Peer-to-Peer Mode

- **Direct exchange** of data, prompts, or artifacts
- **Validation** through digital signatures
- **Use Cases:** Chat relays, opinion blending, redundancy

### B. Hierarchical Delegation

- Task is **delegated downward** to a specialized agent
- Parent maintains **task ownership and audit trail**
- **Use Cases:** Personal assistant spawning a summarizer or planner

### C. Fallback Hierarchy

- Agents form a **failover tree**
- If one fails or times out, another attempts task
- **Use Cases:** High-reliability mission-critical tasks (e.g., home automation)

### D. Swarm Collaboration

- A set of agents form a **temporary or persistent collective**
- Distributed task execution, result fusion
- Governed via `SwarmLogicModule`
- **Use Cases:** Data annotation, model testing, multi-perspective research

### E. Contract-Based Collaboration

- Uses a **signed task contract** (see KLP Task Invocation Spec)
- Agents agree on input/output schema, time limits, rewards
- **Use Cases:** Marketplace-like systems, on-chain AI negotiations

---

## III. Communication Protocols

### A. Local Bus

- Via WebSocket or shared memory (local host)
- Common in browser or container deployments

### B. MeshNet (Reticulum)

- Encrypted P2P over TCP/LoRa
- Uses KindLink overlay routing and TrustLink identity

### C. HTTP/REST

- Standard API interface for interoperability
- Signed request/response headers for agent verification

### D. gRPC + ProtoBuf

- For binary-efficient, schema-defined multi-agent conversations
- Used in high-throughput clusters or mobile-edge-cloud systems

### E. KLP (KindLink Protocol)

- Unified contract system for capability invocation
- Signed, auditable, interoperable
- Basis for AI governance and agent economy

---

## IV. Shared Data Structures

### A. Task Contract Object

```json
{
  "id": "task-0042",
  "issued_by": "agent-kai-001",
  "for": "agent-summarizer-3",
  "input_type": "text:markdown",
  "output_type": "text:summary",
  "expires_at": "2025-07-01T12:00:00Z",
  "reward": 2.5,
  "signed": "0xABC..."
}
```

### B. Shared Memory Segment

- JSON or BSON chunk exchanged over WebSocket/LoRa
- Attached metadata for ownership and TTL

### C. Collaboration Transcript

- Agent-visible audit trail of collaborative actions
- Stored in `logs/agents/interactions/`

---

## V. Agent Roles

| Role      | Description                            | Example             |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Leader    | Delegates, evaluates, finalizes output | Planner agent       |
| Worker    | Performs defined task under contract   | Summarizer agent    |
| Validator | Verifies output against contract       | Audit agent         |
| Relay     | Bridges communication or translation   | Multilingual router |
| Observer  | Records, analyzes, but does not act    | Metrics logger      |

---

## VI. Conflict Resolution

- **Timeouts:** If task is unfulfilled, return control to leader
- **Disputes:** Log discrepancy and call Validator agent
- **Failure Fallback:** Automatically retry with next trusted fallback

---

## VII. Collaboration Logging

All collaborative actions must be:

- **Signed** using agent keypair
- **Hashed** with SHA-256 for immutability
- **Stored** in agent log store with:
  - Timestamp
  - Participants
  - Task ID
  - Input/output digests

---

## VIII. Future Considerations

- Zero-Knowledge Collaboration: Privacy-preserving agents
- Token-Based Incentives: Reward-based AI economics
- Federated Multi-Agent Fine-Tuning
- Autonomous Collective Governance via KLP + voting modules
