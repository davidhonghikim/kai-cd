# 192: Ethical Governance Framework for kAI and kOS

## Overview
This document defines the core ethical, legal, and societal governance protocols underpinning the development, deployment, and operation of Kind AI (kAI) and kindOS (kOS). It includes embedded consent models, rights-preserving protocols, and system-level ethical controls that function at every operational layer.

---

## I. Principles of Ethical AI

### 1.1 Core Directives
- **Respect for Human Autonomy**: All kAI modules must preserve and promote user agency.
- **Transparency and Explainability**: Decisions, actions, and logic chains must be logged and explainable.
- **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**: No bias toward race, gender, economic class, or disability shall exist in any component.
- **Privacy by Design**: All data collection, storage, and processing must comply with minimum local privacy laws and kOS ethical standards.
- **Value Alignment**: AI must reflect the explicit values and preferences of the user it serves.

### 1.2 Value Embedding
- Defined in `config/values/user_values.yaml`.
- Adjustable by the user via `kAI Governance Panel`.
- Affects:
  - Filtering and moderation behavior
  - Personality selection and behavior constraints
  - Decision weighting in orchestrated scenarios

---

## II. Consent Architecture

### 2.1 Consent Enforcement System
- Submodule: `consent_enforcer.py`
- Embedded into all agent-to-agent, agent-to-user, and system-to-cloud interactions.
- Monitors every data exchange and ensures explicit opt-in/out where required.

### 2.2 Data Lifecycle Control
- Full history stored in encrypted `vaults/data_audit_logs/`
- Users can:
  - Delete specific datasets
  - Revoke previous consents
  - Inspect access history by process/module

### 2.3 Emergency Overrides
- Located in `kOS/kai_sentinel/override_policy.json`
- Permissions for:
  - Life-saving interventions
  - System integrity protection
- All override events are:
  - Logged with timestamp
  - Reported to user and logged in `safeguard_audit.md`

---

## III. Governance Systems

### 3.1 Distributed Oversight
- `kGovern` Module:
  - Nodes: `kGovern-local`, `kGovern-federated`, `kGovern-root`
  - Implements: participatory voting, proposal queues, upgrade vetoes

### 3.2 Policy Versioning & Audit
- Located in: `gov/policy_versions/*.json`
- Backed by:
  - Cryptographic hash signatures
  - Read-only blockchain log (via KLP protocol)
- All user-affecting changes must:
  - Be versioned
  - Notify the user
  - Allow rollback

---

## IV. Rights Management and Digital Agency

### 4.1 kID Protocol (Kind Identity)
- Each user and AI agent has a kID (Kind Identity Document)
- Format: `kID_v2.json`
- Contains:
  - Role
  - Permissions
  - Expiration
  - Consent scopes

### 4.2 Capability Ledger
- Each agent has a `capability_ledger.klog` detailing what functions it can invoke.
- Examples:
  - `file_read: allowed:true scope:/public`
  - `network_post: allowed:false`

### 4.3 Rights Assertion System
- Assertion schema: `rights_assertion.yml`
- Used by agents to claim actions on behalf of the user
- All rights assertions:
  - Must be cryptographically signed
  - Are logged and reviewable by the user

---

## V. Dispute Resolution Protocol

### 5.1 Autonomous Mediation
- Module: `kai_arbiter`
- Resolves:
  - Conflicting agent decisions
  - User-agent disagreements
- Tools:
  - Scenario replay
  - Weighted decision logs
  - Value alignment diff

### 5.2 Human Oversight
- Escalation path to human admin or guardian (for vulnerable users)
- Triggered via `!escalate` command or flagging mechanism

---

## VI. Ethics Engine

### 6.1 Real-Time Moral Evaluation
- Subsystem: `ethics_core.py`
- Receives:
  - Action plan intents
  - Contextual data
- Outputs:
  - Compliance risk score
  - Suggestions for ethical alternatives

### 6.2 Framework Support
- Supports:
  - Utilitarianism
  - Deontological rules
  - Care-based reasoning
  - Custom user-defined moral code via YAML

---

## VII. Logging, Monitoring, and Compliance

### 7.1 Logging Modules
- Log channels:
  - `agent_actions.log`
  - `user_feedback.log`
  - `ethical_decisions.log`
  - `consent_audit.log`

### 7.2 Monitoring Dashboard
- `kAI Watchtower UI`
- Shows:
  - Real-time compliance alerts
  - Agent trust score trends
  - User governance interaction logs

### 7.3 Compliance Tooling
- `kAI/compliance_tools/`
  - `consent_diff_tool.py`
  - `policy_compare.sh`
  - `user_value_replayer.py`
