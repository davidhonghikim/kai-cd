# 53: Agent Attestation – Verification, Audit Trails, and Provenance in kAI

This document defines the full design and implementation strategy for **Agent Attestation** within the Kind AI (kAI) ecosystem. Agent Attestation is the set of protocols, cryptographic proofs, and logs that establish **what an agent did**, **when it did it**, and **under whose authority**.

---

## I. Purpose

Attestation in kAI ensures that all autonomous behavior by agents—whether modifying configs, interacting with users, or communicating via KLP—is:

- Cryptographically **verifiable**
- **Timestamped** and **auditable**
- **Traceable** to specific user intents or governing policies
- Usable for **security**, **governance**, **accountability**, and **reputation building**

---

## II. Directory Structure

```text
src/
└── attestation/
    ├── AttestationManager.ts          # Core manager for logging, signing, verification
    ├── AttestationLog.ts              # Append-only log format with rotation
    ├── AttestationVerifier.ts         # Module for verifying external claims
    ├── structures/
    │   ├── AttestationRecord.ts       # Schema for single attestation entry
    │   └── AttestationProof.ts        # Cryptographic wrapper and signature
    └── audit/
        ├── AgentEventHooks.ts         # Hooks for events to auto-generate attestations
        └── CLI_AuditViewer.ts         # Tool for listing/inspecting local agent attestations
```

---

## III. Attestation Record Format

Each attestation is a structured, signed, immutable record:

```ts
interface AttestationRecord {
  id: string; // UUID
  agentId: DID;
  timestamp: string;
  context: string; // e.g. "config.save", "klp.capability_request"
  payload: object; // Redacted-sensitive
  performedBy: DID; // user or delegating entity
  verified?: boolean;
}

interface AttestationProof {
  record: AttestationRecord;
  signature: string; // Ed25519 of SHA256(record)
}
```

> ⚠️ Signed attestations are stored locally and can optionally be anchored to external proof stores or IPFS.

---

## IV. Event Hooks & Autologging

All major agent actions will trigger an **Attestation Hook**:

| Action Category    | Example Hook          | Record Context    |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Configuration Save | `onConfigSave()`      | `config.save`     |
| Message Sent       | `onOutboundMessage()` | `comms.outbound`  |
| KLP Link Created   | `onKLPHandshake()`    | `klp.link`        |
| File Access        | `onFileAccess()`      | `artifact.access` |
| Workflow Execution | `onWorkflowStart()`   | `workflow.exec`   |

These generate `AttestationRecord`s automatically, reducing dev effort and increasing integrity.

---

## V. Verification & Cross-Entity Sharing

### A. Local Verification

- Validate signature of attestation
- Verify DID ownership of agent/user keys
- Confirm context and timestamp boundaries

### B. External Verification

- Share `AttestationProof` with:
  - kOS governance hub
  - External agents (via KLP)
  - Audit dashboards

### C. Optional Anchoring

- Attestation hashes can be anchored to:
  - IPFS (content addressable)
  - Blockchain (future module: `AttestationAnchors.ts`)

---

## VI. Access & CLI Tools

### CLI Audit Tool

```bash
kai audit list           # View recent attestations
kai audit inspect <id>   # View detailed proof, signature
kai audit export --json  # Export all attestations
```

---

## VII. Configurable Attestation Modes

| Mode      | Description                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Silent    | No logging (dev/test only)                     |
| LocalOnly | Signed, local logs only                        |
| Anchored  | Local + blockchain/IPFS anchor                 |
| Federated | Share attestation streams to trusted neighbors |

Config file:

```toml
[attestation]
mode = "Anchored"
log_rotation_days = 7
ipfs_gateway = "https://ipfs.kos.local"
```

---

## VIII. Use Cases & Extensions

- **Agent Accountability** – trace unwanted behavior
- **Governance Voting Audits** – verify vote origin and signature
- **Multi-agent Trust** – embed attestation proofs in KLP trust links
- **Explainability** – support user questions like "Why did agent X do that?"

---

## IX. Roadmap

| Feature                             | Version |
| ----------------------------------- | ------- |
| Initial Attestation Hooks           | v0.9    |
| IPFS Anchoring + View Tool          | v1.0    |
| DID Signature Verification (Remote) | v1.2    |
| zkProof Extension for Agent Claims  | v1.5    |
| Blockchain Anchoring Plugin         | v2.0    |

This system is foundational to trust in autonomous systems. It makes every action provable, reviewable, and defensible.
