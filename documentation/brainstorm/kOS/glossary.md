## ðŸ“˜ Glossary â€” Mobile AI Cluster System (Expanded)

This glossary is extracted from all completed and planned documentation titles (001â€“504). It includes all critical concepts, protocols, and architectural terms.

---

### A
**Agent** â€” Autonomous software unit capable of acting, communicating, and adapting in real-time.  
**Agent Affinity Mapping** â€” Strategy for assigning agents to tasks based on specialization, location, or trust.  
**Agent Bootstrapping** â€” Initialization routines that configure agent behavior, memory, and communication.
**Agent Trust Protocols** â€” Rules governing agent reputation, cryptographic identity, attestation, and scoring.

### B
**Behavior Tree Controller** â€” Logic structure that governs conditional agent actions.
**Boot Profile** â€” Structured node or agent startup configuration including memory and execution flags.

### C
**Cluster** â€” A coordinated group of agents or nodes forming a cooperative compute network.
**CRDT** â€” Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type; ensures sync without needing locks or central authority.
**Consensus Layer** â€” The logic that enables agents to collectively reach a decision.

### D
**DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake)** â€” Lightweight consensus used to elect trusted agents for governance or coordination.
**Distributed Cognition** â€” A shared mental model formed across multiple agents.

### E
**Edge Node** â€” Resource-limited computing node located at the perimeter of the network.
**Event Handling** â€” Structured mechanism for responding to signals and triggers in an agent.

### F
**Fallback Chain** â€” A series of backup actions or agents activated when primary systems fail.
**Federated Intelligence** â€” Distributed learning across swarms where insights are combined post-processing.

### G
**Gossip Protocol** â€” Agent-to-agent communication pattern for propagating data in a decentralized manner.
**Goal Alignment** â€” Ensuring agent behavior remains synchronized with swarm or user intent.

### H
**Heartbeat Signal** â€” A periodic broadcast to show an agent or device is alive and responsive.
**Hivemind** â€” The shared intelligence or consensus mechanism across a swarm.

### I
**Intent Modeling** â€” Predicting user goals based on prompts, context, and previous behavior.
**Interface Shell** â€” The frontend logic container for agents to interact with users or each other.

### K
**Knowledge Diffusion** â€” The spread of insights, models, and updates across agents or swarms.

### L
**Ledger** â€” An append-only, cryptographically verifiable log of events, often used in trust and audit systems.
**LoRa** â€” Long-range, low-power wireless protocol used for offline or mesh communication.

### M
**Mesh Network** â€” Peer-to-peer network topology in which each node relays information to its neighbors.
**Memory Graph** â€” A distributed, cooperative storage and retrieval structure for inter-agent knowledge.

### N
**Node** â€” Any individual compute device in the cluster.

### P
**Persona** â€” A defined behavioral configuration that changes how an agent responds or expresses itself.
**PromptKind** â€” The overarching system philosophy of agentic kindness, expressiveness, creativity, and user sovereignty.

### Q
**Quorum** â€” Minimum subset of agents required to approve or validate a swarm decision.

### R
**Reputation Score** â€” Trust metric calculated from agent performance, reliability, and peer endorsements.
**Role Negotiation** â€” Protocol by which agents dynamically accept or decline specific tasks.

### S
**Swarm** â€” A temporary, goal-oriented grouping of agents.
**Swarm Clock** â€” Logical synchronization method for ordered events in a swarm (e.g., Lamport timestamps).
**Swarm Contract** â€” A temporary agreement signed by swarm agents outlining task roles, fallback logic, and trust conditions.

### T
**Task Assignment Strategy** â€” Logic for routing goals to appropriate agents.
**Trust Zones** â€” Security levels that separate agent behavior and access control based on trust tier.

### U
**UI Shell** â€” The agent-facing container used for interface rendering and user interaction.
**Untrusted Zone** â€” Designated area for low-trust agents, used for quarantine and observation.

### V
**Vector Clock** â€” An advanced logical clock system used for event causality in decentralized logs.

### Z
**ZK-Proof (Zero-Knowledge Proof)** â€” Cryptographic method to verify that an agent has certain attributes without revealing underlying data.
