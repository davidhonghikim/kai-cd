# 253: Agent Identity & Signature Framework (kIDF)

## Overview

The **Kind Identity & Signature Framework (kIDF)** defines how agents within the kAI/kOS ecosystem uniquely identify themselves, sign outputs, and provide cryptographic proof of authorship and operational legitimacy. This framework is foundational for secure agent interaction, provenance tracking, versioning, accountability, and trust.

---

## Goals

- Assign cryptographically verifiable identities to all agents.
- Digitally sign outputs and data artifacts.
- Support distributed trust, not centralized control.
- Enable proof of authorship, origin, and operational parameters.
- Prevent impersonation and unauthorized code execution.

---

## Identity Model

Each agent is provisioned with a persistent, unique identity, consisting of the following components:

### `kID` (Kind Identity)

- A decentralized, cryptographically anchored ID.
- Example format: `kID:agent:kindai:dev0001`
- Backed by public key cryptography (see below).

### Keypairs

- Each agent generates a **keypair** (Ed25519 preferred).
- Public keys are stored in the **kID Registry** (global or local).
- Private keys are kept in secure vaults and used for signing.

### Metadata (Attached to `kID`)

- Agent name
- Version (semver)
- Role type (e.g., `Builder`, `Observer`, `Deployer`, `Guardian`)
- Capabilities (declared APIs and operations)
- Organization or cluster affiliation
- Creation and expiration timestamps

---

## Signature Protocol

All output generated by an agent should be signed using its private key.

### Artifact Signing

- Each document, script, configuration, or action log is signed.
- SHA-256 hash of the content is created, then signed with the agent's private key.
- Signature is embedded in file footer or sidecar `.sig` file.

**Example Footer:**

```
---
Signed-by: kID:agent:kindai:dev0001
SHA256: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
Signature: <base64 encoded signature>
```

### Runtime Signing

Agents also sign:

- Webhook payloads
- Inter-agent messages
- Deployment manifests
- Service configuration transactions
- AI-generated prompts or completions (optional by config)

---

## Registry & Verification

### kID Registry

- Distributed and/or federated database of public agent profiles.
- Stores agent metadata and public keys.
- Mirrors on IPFS, kOS, or blockchain (e.g., KLP ledger).
- Optional expiration and revocation tracking.

### Verification Workflow

1. Validate content hash matches expected hash.
2. Verify signature with agent's public key from the kID Registry.
3. Check agent's trust level (via TrustSeal or custom org policy).
4. Log verification metadata for audit.

---

## Trust Levels & Endorsements

Agents can be endorsed with trust tags:

- `Trusted:Core` – Maintained by KindAI core team
- `Trusted:Org:<org>` – Endorsed by specific organization
- `Audited` – Codebase and output independently reviewed
- `Sandboxed` – Running in isolated mode
- `Expired` – Key expired or revoked

**Trust logic** is extensible and pluggable into kOS validation pipelines.

---

## Integration Points

- `kOS Agent Kernel` loads agent metadata, keys, and verifies outputs.
- `kAI Shell` and `kAI Orchestrator` include signature check options for each action.
- `Vault` agent securely stores private keys, rotates them on policy.
- `AuditLog` appends signature info for every signed operation.

---

## Future Work

- Cross-chain signature interoperability (Ethereum, Solana, etc.)
- DID-based agent identities
- Post-quantum key compatibility
- Anonymous agent roles with zk-SNARK verification

---

## Summary

The kIDF framework brings agent-level integrity, non-repudiation, and decentralized accountability to the Kind ecosystem. It is a non-optional, zero-trust foundation for secure, collaborative, auditable agent behavior across local and distributed systems.
