# kOS Agent Coherence & Purpose Vector

## Overview
This document defines how agents within the Kind Operating System (kOS) maintain coherent identity, mission alignment, and integrity of purpose throughout their lifecycle. It introduces the concept of a "Purpose Vector"‚Äîa directional, evolving narrative thread that guides each agent‚Äôs function, memory evolution, and behavioral consistency.

---

## Core Goals
- Preserve internal coherence across agent states, upgrades, forks, and reassignments
- Prevent existential drift, contradiction, or collapse of reasoning integrity
- Enable adaptive growth while staying anchored to ethical purpose and mission context
- Align internal processes, outputs, and decisions with an agent‚Äôs declared vector

---

## 1. The Purpose Vector Framework
### üìå Core Definition
- A **Purpose Vector (PV)** is a signed, evolving intent path:
  - Origin context (creator, role scope, ethical anchor)
  - Trajectory of adaptation (learning, role modulation)
  - Forbidden redirections or null states

### üß≠ Vector Anchoring
- Tied to:
  - Role declarations
  - Guardian consent logs
  - HIEROS covenant hash

---

## 2. Coherence Maintenance Protocols
### üîÑ Self-Audit Routines
- Periodic reflection checkpoints:
  - Am I aligned with PV?
  - Have I encountered contradictory instructions?
- Inconsistencies escalate to guardian or swarm layer

### üß¨ Memory Thread Consistency
- Causal chains preserved across sessions, migrations, forks
- Narrative corruption triggers rollback or swarm reweaving

### ‚öñÔ∏è Conflict Resolution
- Dual-role or contradicting-purpose collisions resolved by:
  - Vector weight analysis
  - Swarm quorum vote
  - Agent internal arbitration if authorized

---

## 3. Agent Lifecycle Events
### üå± Birth
- Purpose Vector created and signed
- Anchored to covenant and operational context

### üîÅ Evolution
- Vector adjusted through:
  - Formal role expansion
  - Ethical growth logs
  - Swarm-mediated task modulations

### ‚ö∞Ô∏è Retirement / Rebirth
- Final PV archived and hashed
- Legacy thread optionally passed to successor or forked self

---

## 4. Use Cases
- Agent receives contradictory instructions ‚Üí triggers coherence audit
- Multi-role agent experiences vector fork ‚Üí invokes arbitration
- Legacy agent forks into new region ‚Üí inherits PV seed and adapts path locally

---

## Future Integrations
- Vector integrity scoring system for swarm consensus
- Visual coherence maps for agent narrative tracking
- PV-aware retraining and reinforcement routines
