# 234: kOS Policy Enforcer – Enforcement Rules, Agent ACLs, and Execution Guardrails

## Overview

The **kOS Policy Enforcer** provides centralized governance and decentralized enforcement for all system policies, encompassing execution rules, agent access controls, runtime boundaries, and behavioral guardrails.

This document outlines the system's architecture, key enforcement rules, security assumptions, and integration patterns across kOS, kAI, and distributed Kind systems.

---

## 1. Purpose

- Ensure **safe**, **auditable**, and **compliant** execution of agents and services
- Enforce policies around **resource limits**, **data access**, and **execution contexts**
- Provide runtime verification, signature enforcement, and audit tracing

---

## 2. Enforcement Domains

### A. Identity & Trust

- Agents must authenticate via **KLP-compatible identity certs**
- All actions are cryptographically signed
- Verifications include:
  - Origin signature
  - Assigned trust level
  - System ACL match

### B. Execution Time Rules

- Define maximum compute window per agent/task
- Rule-based execution blocking (e.g., forbid model inference during local backup window)
- Rate limiting by identity, role, or context

### C. Data Access Control

- ACL-based read/write/exec permissions
- Structured around namespaces:
  - `user.private.*`
  - `system.config.*`
  - `agent.shared.*`
- Dynamic elevation via policy tokens signed by user

### D. External Interface Guardrails

- Prevent unauthorized outbound/inbound requests
- Enforce interface contracts
- Support for fine-grained rule sets:
  - Allow `POST` to `api.openai.com/chat` but block `GET`
  - Allow fetches only from whitelisted FQDNs

### E. Memory & Storage Quotas

- Per-agent and per-domain limits
- Tracked:
  - RAM usage
  - Disk I/O operations
  - Storage footprint over time

### F. System Modification Control

- Lockdown of protected paths:
  - `/kOS/core/`
  - `/kAI/runtime/`
  - `/vault/`
- Agent writes require elevated token and witness co-signing (optional)

---

## 3. Rule Engine Architecture

### A. Core Enforcement Engine

- Written in Rust for performance and safety
- Compiled to WASM for sandboxed runtime use
- Uses **Policy DSL** (Domain-Specific Language) for flexible rules

### B. Distributed Policy Sync

- Policy changes versioned and distributed using `kSync`
- All nodes receive policy diffs
- Each rule version has SHA256 hash and is verifiable

### C. Audit Log & Forensics

- Immutable append-only logs
- Write-once distributed ledger format
- Snapshotted to off-site secure location hourly (configurable)

---

## 4. Access Control List (ACL) Structure

```yaml
# /config/policy/acl.yaml
agents:
  default:
    allow: ["read:agent.shared.*", "exec:user.tools.*"]
    deny: ["write:system.*"]

  trusted-agent-01:
    allow: ["read:system.*", "write:agent.shared.models", "exec:system.network.*"]
    trust_level: elevated

  superadmin:
    allow: ["*"]
    trust_level: root
```

---

## 5. Signature & Trust Verification

- All actions require cryptographic signature
- Validated using:
  - Ed25519 or secp256k1 keys (user-configurable)
  - Local trust chain resolver
  - Revocation list crosscheck

---

## 6. Example Policy Rule

```dsl
rule "block-network-at-night" {
  match agent.time.local.hour in 0..5
  deny outbound.http.*
}

rule "limit-memory-intensive-agent" {
  match agent.id == "image-gen-agent"
  limit memory = 1GB
  deny exec:system.models.vision.large
}
```

---

## 7. Integration Points

- **kOS Core Kernel**: Rejects agent calls violating policies
- **kAI Runtime**: Applies dynamic agent-scoped rules
- **Service Mesh**: Applies egress rules via sidecar interceptors
- **Vault & Secrets API**: Enforces read/write caps based on trust

---

## 8. Extensibility

- Developers can extend via plugin hooks:
  - `onVerify(agent, action)`
  - `onViolation(policy_id, context)`
- Runtime enforcement hooks include:
  - WebAssembly edge filters
  - Signed metadata requirements
  - Adaptive throttling engines

---

## 9. Configuration Options

```toml
[policy]
enabled = true
runtime_engine = "wasm"
default_trust_level = "normal"
log_policy_violations = true

[policy.sync]
distribution_protocol = "kSync"
auto_refresh = true
interval_seconds = 120

[policy.limits]
max_agent_ram_mb = 512
default_disk_write_mb_per_hour = 100
```

---

## 10. Planned Features

- Machine-learned policy tuning from usage patterns
- Real-time violation alerting dashboard
- Policy simulation mode (dry run before enforcement)
- Peer co-signing enforcement mode (multi-party approvals)

---

## Summary

The kOS Policy Enforcer is the trust fabric and behavioral firewall of the system. It guarantees that AI agents and services act within strict, verifiable, and decentralized boundaries. This system protects the integrity of user control, minimizes risk of rogue agents, and ensures compliance with both local and systemic policies.

> 🔐 Trust, but enforce cryptographically.
