# 00: Index and Overview of KindOS (kOS) and KindAI (kAI) Architecture

This document serves as the master index for all documentation within the Kind ecosystem, including architectural blueprints, component specifications, protocols, configuration schemas, and operational workflows for KindAI (`kAI`) and KindOS (`kOS`).

All documents follow the structure:
- **Prefix ID**: Numerical order for deterministic navigation
- **Title**: Descriptive PascalCase
- **Purpose**: Build-ready detail

---

## System Summary

### KindAI (kAI)
A personal AI framework, application gateway, and orchestration client. It can be run as a:
- Browser extension
- Desktop app
- Embedded interface
- Secure agent controller

### KindOS (kOS)
A decentralized operating stack built for AI-human collaboration:
- Secure, interoperable multi-agent mesh
- Governance, routing, protocols
- Data and service control
- Local-first but cloud/peer-optional

### Assets & Visuals
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `assets/kos_architecture.png` | Layered architecture diagram |
| `assets/kai_browser_ui.png` | Browser extension UI |

## Conventions

- All config files use `.yaml` or `.json`
- All secrets use `.vault` encrypted JSON
- All Markdown is stored in `docs/` or `agents/docs/`
- CamelCase used for internal class names and folders
- External interfaces are lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `/api/load-service-config`)

---

## Download Instructions
Each file listed above will be created as its own canvas document with download enabled.

Once the full set is built:
- Files can be individually downloaded
- An agent can split, reassemble, or package them further

---

## Next Step
Proceeding to build `01_System_Architecture.md` with full low-level detail for the agent mesh, UI flows, backend channels, identity layers, governance overlays, memory partitions, and all communications.
