# 165: kOS Governance System – Rulesets, Voting, Federation, and Sovereignty Protocols

This document defines the foundational governance mechanisms for the Kind Operating System (kOS), including agent and user rights, decision-making protocols, federation integration, consensus systems, and ruleset enforcement. The design supports both private and public deployments of kAI and kOS within sovereign communities or networks.

---

## I. Core Principles

- **Decentralized Sovereignty**: Each kOS instance can operate independently with its own rules.
- **Composable Governance**: Rulesets can be imported, extended, or forked.
- **Transparent Protocols**: All changes and decisions are logged and cryptographically signed.
- **Human-AI Co-Governance**: Decisions can involve human stakeholders, AI agents, or both.

---

## II. Governance Components

### A. Ruleset Engine

- YAML-based modular definitions
- Types:
  - **Hard Rules**: Cannot be overridden without federation consensus
  - **Soft Rules**: Locally overrideable, but reported to federation
- Rule ID format: `org.namespace.rule_name.version`

### B. Role & Permissions

- Roles: `admin`, `user`, `agent`, `service`, `observer`, `auditor`
- Permission system:

```yaml
permissions:
  can_vote: [user, admin]
  can_modify_ruleset: [admin]
  can_trigger_proposals: [agent, admin]
  can_request_exemption: [agent, user]
```

- Identity is validated through KLP identity chain

### C. Proposal System

- Proposal Types:
  - Add/Amend/Remove rule
  - Add/Remove agents or services
  - Budget allocations (resource or time)
- Proposal Format:

```yaml
id: prop-007
proposer: user:jane
action: amend
rule: org.kos.safety.hard_shutdown
new_value: "timeout: 5m"
deadline: 2025-07-01T00:00:00Z
tags: [safety, emergency]
```

## III. Voting Mechanisms

### A. Local Voting

- Each instance has its own ledger
- Pluggable vote methods:
  - 1P1V (One Person One Vote)
  - Token-weighted
  - Reputation-weighted
  - Hybrid quadratic

### B. Federated Voting

- Consensus propagation via KLP (Kind Link Protocol)
- Federation structure:
  - Root Federation (e.g., kind.network)
  - Regional/Subnet federations
  - Independent peer nodes
- Voting results are KLP-signed and replayable

### C. AI Agent Voting

- Agents can be assigned voting power via:
  - Delegated authority
  - Performance-based trust index
  - Multi-agent consensus thresholds
- Agent votes are introspectable and replayable via audit system

---

## IV. Federation Protocols

### A. Federation ID

- Structure: `klp://org/federation_name/instance_id`
- Stored in instance config

### B. Membership Declaration

- Signed by federation authority + instance
- Required fields:

```yaml
instance: klp://cooperative/earth/kai01
signed_by: klp://cooperative/earth
rights:
  - vote
  - rule_sync
  - alert_share
join_date: 2025-06-22T00:00:00Z
```

### C. Dispute Resolution

- Two modes:
  - Automatic (ruleset-based)
  - Human arbitration (external panel or court)
- Resolution log appended to immutable audit trail

---

## V. Governance Config Example

```yaml
governance:
  ruleset_path: ./rulesets/core.yaml
  identity:
    klp_id: klp://sovereign/kai-unit-001
    role: admin
  voting:
    type: hybrid_quadratic
    quorum: 60%
    timeout: 72h
  federation:
    enabled: true
    root: klp://kind.network/main
    allow_sync: true
  logging:
    audit_enabled: true
    replayable: true
```

---

## VI. System Integration Points

- **Prompt Management**: Agents can propose changes to prompt scaffolding or restrictions
- **Security Manager**: Governs emergency shutdown rights and credential rotation
- **Deployment Manager**: Tracks resource allocations and uptime rules
- **Vault Manager**: Federated secrets audit trail compliance
- **Logging System**: Immutable records of votes, proposals, rule changes

---

## VII. Future Expansions

- Real-time polling widgets for UI overlay
- GPT-based deliberation forums (simulated assemblies)
- Privacy-preserving federation (ZK signatures for votes)
- DAO-style token incentives for rule participation

---

### Changelog

- 2025-06-22 • Initial governance protocol for kOS federation and local sovereignty
