# 239: kAI Plugin Sandbox – Secure Execution Environment

## Overview

The `kAI Plugin Sandbox` is a secure, controlled execution environment for third-party and user-defined plugins. It ensures isolation from core system processes, strict enforcement of access controls, and limits on resource usage.

This document outlines the technical design, security protocols, execution lifecycle, and integration points of the sandbox system within the kAI ecosystem.

---

## 🧱 Core Objectives

- **Isolation**: Run plugins in secure containers or VM contexts with no direct access to core system memory or other agents.
- **Security**: Prevent malicious plugins from accessing unauthorized data or system APIs.
- **Auditability**: Log and monitor all plugin activities for forensic and debugging purposes.
- **Extensibility**: Allow user-defined plugins to integrate safely into workflows.

---

## 🔐 Sandbox Architecture

### 1. Execution Models

- **In-Process VM (default)**: Lightweight execution via JavaScript VMs like `vm2`, Python `RestrictedPython`, or WASM runtimes.
- **Out-of-Process Containers**: Docker-based execution for heavier, stateful, or less-trusted plugins.
- **Remote Execution Nodes** (optional): Offload to external sandboxed nodes with rate-limited RPC.

### 2. Permission Model

Each plugin declares a manifest:

```json
{
  "id": "plugin.gptweather",
  "name": "Weather Fetcher",
  "permissions": [
    "http_request",
    "read_config",
    "log_output"
  ],
  "resource_limits": {
    "cpu": "100ms",
    "memory": "32mb",
    "disk": "1mb"
  }
}
```

### 3. Capabilities

| Capability     | Description                    | Default  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| http\_request  | Allow outbound fetch/API calls | Denied   |
| file\_read     | Read local files               | Denied   |
| read\_config   | Access kAI config/agent config | ReadOnly |
| log\_output    | Emit logs to system console    | Allowed  |
| spawn\_process | Run sub-processes              | Denied   |

## 🛠️ Sandbox Lifecycle

### Plugin Lifecycle Hooks

- `onLoad()` – Called at registration
- `onActivate(context)` – When triggered or added to workflow
- `onMessage(message)` – When receiving input/trigger
- `onShutdown()` – Cleanup

### Execution Context

Each plugin is passed:

```ts
interface SandboxContext {
  user: { id: string; role: 'admin' | 'guest' };
  config: PluginConfig;
  memory: SharedMemory;
  emit: (event: string, payload: any) => void;
  fetch: typeof fetch;
}
```

### Execution Limits

- **Max CPU Time**: 100ms (in-process) / 2s (docker)
- **Memory Limit**: 32MB (in-process) / 256MB (docker)
- **Timeout**: Plugins must respond within time limit or be force-killed.

## 📦 Plugin Packaging Format

```plaintext
plugin/
  ├── manifest.json
  ├── index.js / index.py / index.wasm
  ├── assets/
  └── README.md
```

---

## 🛡️ Security Protections

- **Read-only FS**: Sandboxes have no write access to base system.
- **No Shared Memory**: All data passed explicitly via context.
- **Rate Limits**: Outbound requests throttled.
- **Key Escrow**: Secrets injected per-call, not persisted.
- **Egress Filtering**: IP/domain blocklist for outbound access.
- **Audit Logs**: Every action stored in append-only journal.

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Auditing

- Every plugin run is logged:
  - Start time, user ID, plugin ID
  - Permissions used
  - Outbound network requests
  - CPU, memory usage
  - Errors/exceptions
- Admin dashboard shows runtime stats
- Suspicious plugins can be blacklisted

---

## 🧩 Integration with kAI

- Sandboxed plugins can:
  - Listen for messages from agents
  - Emit UI cards, system notifications, or events
  - Modify draft memory (if permissioned)
- Can be chained via workflows or schedule-based triggers

---

## 🔄 Update & Revocation

- Plugins checked against signature chain / hash registry (via kRegistry)
- Revoked plugins are auto-disabled across all users
- Auto-updates require valid signed manifests

---

## ✅ Use Cases

- Agent actions (e.g. auto-translate, file conversion)
- Personal tools (e.g. daily task scripts)
- External integrations (e.g. send Slack message)
- Generative plugins (e.g. generate image/audio)

---

## ⚠️ Developer Responsibilities

- Must declare all permissions
- Must include README with usage and risks
- Plugins using non-permitted APIs will be terminated
- Malicious plugins will be permanently banned

---

## 🔚 Summary

The kAI Plugin Sandbox is the foundation for secure, dynamic, user-extendable functionality in the kAI ecosystem. It balances extensibility with robust isolation, providing a path for safe third-party innovation without compromising user control or system integrity.
