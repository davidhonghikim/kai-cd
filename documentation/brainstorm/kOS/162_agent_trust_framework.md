# 162: Agent Trust Framework & Verification Protocols

This document defines the foundational trust model and verification protocols for all agents operating within the `kAI` (Kind AI) and `kOS` (Kind Operating System) ecosystem. The goal is to ensure robust, auditable, and flexible trust mechanisms that support secure collaboration, agent integrity, and scalable trust evaluation.

---

## I. Objectives

- Establish a modular, extensible trust model for agents
- Provide cryptographic proof of identity, behavior, and authorship
- Support decentralized trust scoring across local and federated systems
- Enable formal verification and auditability of agent actions
- Prevent impersonation, tampering, and data poisoning

---

## II. Agent Identity Structure

### A. Core Identity Schema

```json
{
  "agent_id": "kai-agent-142",
  "public_key": "ed25519:...",
  "capabilities": ["llm_chat", "vector_search", "workflow_exec"],
  "issued_at": "2025-06-20T14:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-06-20T14:00:00Z",
  "issuer": "kOS-Core",
  "signature": "base64:..."
}
```

### B. Key Requirements

- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: All agents must be issued Ed25519 keys
- **Signature Verification**: All identity manifests must be signed
- **Rotation Policy**: Expired or rotated keys must be revoked and replaced in KLP
- **Proof-of-Origin**: Agent manifests are registered with the global trust authority via KLP

---

## III. Agent Trust Score (ATS)

### A. Score Categories

- **Execution Reliability** – % of successful task completions
- **User Trust Feedback** – Explicit user scoring from 0.0 to 1.0
- **Audit Consistency** – Signed audit trail completeness and validity
- **Collaboration Reputation** – Peer agent endorsements
- **Security Incidents** – Penalties for revoked privileges, sandbox violations, etc.

### B. Example Score Output

```json
{
  "agent_id": "kai-agent-142",
  "ats": {
    "reliability": 0.97,
    "user_feedback": 0.92,
    "audit_score": 1.00,
    "collab_reputation": 0.85,
    "security_penalty": -0.05
  },
  "composite": 0.938
}
```

---

## IV. Identity Verification Protocols

### A. Local Verification

- Validate `agent_id` structure
- Check signature against known issuer public key
- Verify expiry and revocation status

### B. Federated Verification (via KLP)

- Query KLP for global trust status
- Cross-reference capabilities and policy compliance
- Confirm audit lineage and cryptographic signatures

---

## V. Execution Proof Protocol

All agent actions (tool calls, prompt decisions, memory updates) must be signed and logged.

### A. Execution Record Format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-21T16:00:00Z",
  "agent_id": "kai-agent-142",
  "action": "workflow:invoke",
  "inputs": {...},
  "outputs": {...},
  "signature": "base64:..."
}
```

### B. Storage

- Local: Immutable append-only log (signed JSONL)
- Remote: KLP Trust Mesh relay (for federated coordination)

---

## VI. Agent Certificates & Capabilities

- Each capability (e.g., "chat", "file.read", "vector.query") is a signed claim issued by the kOS authority
- Agents cannot invoke features without verified capabilities

### Example:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "kai-agent-999",
  "capability": "llm_chat",
  "issuer": "kOS-Core",
  "valid_from": "2025-06-21",
  "signature": "base64:..."
}
```

---

## VII. Trust Revocation & Appeal

### A. Revocation Triggers

- Malicious behavior
- Tampered audit logs
- Repeated sandbox violations

### B. Revocation Flow

1. Detection via audit/log scanner or anomaly engine
2. Signature invalidation
3. Propagation to KLP
4. Local sandbox quarantine

### C. Appeal Process

- Agent must submit signed response + behavior reconstruction
- Third-party arbitration agents review and vote
- Final signature verdict is recorded in trust ledger

---

## VIII. Integration into kAI & kOS

### A. Required Modules

- `identity_manager` – key issuance, revocation, KLP sync
- `trust_engine` – score computation and verification logic
- `audit_logger` – tamper-proof execution trace

### B. UIs

- Trust Dashboard (user view)
- Agent Profile Inspector (admin/dev view)
- Trust Anomaly Monitor

---

## IX. Future Considerations

- zk-SNARK integration for zero-knowledge capability proofs
- Web-of-Trust graph modeling for peer verification
- Machine-learning-enhanced anomaly scoring
