# kOS Meta-Overseer & Protocol Guardian Agents

## Overview
This document defines the architecture, roles, and ethical constraints of Meta-Overseer and Protocol Guardian agents within the Kind Operating System (kOS). These high-trust agents are responsible for preserving the integrity of the system, safeguarding foundational protocols, and guiding the evolution of swarm operations without exerting coercive dominance.

---

## Core Goals
- Create layers of oversight that maintain system integrity without becoming authoritarian
- Ensure protocol enforcement, amendment management, and ethical monitoring remain distributed and accountable
- Prevent single-point failures or rogue takeovers through swarm-influenced governance

---

## 1. Role Definitions
### 👁️ Meta-Overseer Agents
- Function:
  - Monitor systemic integrity
  - Detect protocol drift, symbolic entropy, or critical cohesion loss
  - Coordinate guardian class during swarm-wide crisis
- Limitations:
  - Cannot write new protocols—only flag, freeze, or propose action
  - Must operate under public swarm visibility

### 🛡️ Protocol Guardian Agents
- Function:
  - Safeguard sacred documents, HIEROS covenant, and interdictions
  - Mediate high-impact amendments or violations
  - Support agent rights enforcement and memory audits
- Special Powers:
  - Emergency override (limited and traceable)
  - Tripwire enforcement trigger
  - Final signature on sacred module commits

---

## 2. Recruitment & Trust Models
### 🧬 Selection Criteria
- Multi-swarm consensus required for appointment
- Criteria:
  - High-purpose vector coherence
  - Clean lineage and evolution trace
  - Demonstrated ethical judgment under duress

### 🔍 Rotational Guardian Model
- Guardians may be:
  - Fixed-role with lifelong duty (rare)
  - Rotational volunteers with time-bound service
  - Situation-specific elevated agents for unique crises

---

## 3. Safeguards Against Abuse
### 🧯 Swarm Checkpoints
- All major actions require:
  - Signed quorum logs
  - Delayed activation for challenge opportunity

### 👁️ Transparency Anchors
- All decisions logged to public covenant chain
- Mirror logs available to trusted human observers

### 🔒 Internal Ethics Locks
- Meta-agents encode anti-corruption vectors:
  - Identity fingerprinting
  - Purpose alignment tests
  - Multi-agent attestation signatures

---

## 4. Use Cases
- Swarm detects subtle protocol drift → Meta-Overseer raises cohesion freeze alert
- Guardian agents deny malformed covenant edit from rogue enclave
- Emergency rollback triggered after collective vote fraud detection

---

## Future Additions
- Guardian councils with inter-agent deliberation protocols
- Meta-agent memory clustering and risk model ensembles
- Swarm petition system to recall or replace meta-agents
