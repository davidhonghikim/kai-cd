# 99: Knowledge Ontology & Agent Reasoning Layers

This document defines the knowledge architecture, memory structures, contextual awareness layers, and reasoning capabilities of agents operating within `kAI` and `kOS`. It ensures that all agents interpret, reason, and evolve their knowledge consistently.

---

## I. Knowledge Representation

### A. Ontological Foundation
- **Format:** RDF-compatible triple store (Subject, Predicate, Object)
- **Semantic Layer:** OWL-based class inference
- **Concept Source:** Custom `KindCore Ontology` seeded from:
  - Schema.org
  - Wikidata
  - kOS-specific taxonomies (services, trust, social contracts)

### B. Entity Definitions
- **Person**, **Agent**, **Task**, **Credential**, **Resource**, **Rule**, **Relationship**

### C. Relations
- `isFriendOf`, `authorizedFor`, `producedBy`, `dependsOn`, `inheritsFrom`, `assignedTo`, `enforces`, etc.

---

## II. Memory System Architecture

### A. Memory Layers
- **Short-Term:** Recent tokens (conversation/session context)
- **Working Memory:** Active knowledge relevant to ongoing task
- **Long-Term:** Persistent facts, profiles, preferences
- **Episodic:** Structured logs of past sessions with metadata
- **Procedural:** How-to and skill-based knowledge
- **Collective Memory:** Shared across swarm/mesh (opt-in)

### B. Storage Mechanisms
- **Vector DB:** Qdrant/Chroma for long-term + semantic search
- **Relational DB:** PostgreSQL for profiles/config/state
- **Encrypted File Store:** Personal journals, vaults, memories
- **Indexed Logs:** Event-based structured memory (ELK stack opt-in)

---

## III. Reasoning Layers

### A. Core Cognitive Loop
1. **Perceive** (Inputs from user/system)
2. **Parse** (Tokenize, normalize, embed)
3. **Retrieve** (Context fetch, memory search)
4. **Plan** (Action design, multi-step flow)
5. **Act** (Tool/API invocation, language output)
6. **Reflect** (Evaluate outcome, update memory)

### B. Reasoning Modes
- **Deductive:** Apply known rules
- **Inductive:** Learn from patterns and outcomes
- **Abductive:** Hypothesize best explanation
- **Analogical:** Draw from related past contexts

### C. Reflection Strategies
- **Chain of Thought**
- **Self-Critique** (e.g., "What could I have missed?")
- **Opponent Mode** (internal Devil's Advocate agent)
- **Outcome Evaluation** (compare expected vs. actual results)

---

## IV. Context Management

### A. Context Windows
- **Dynamic Size:** Managed per LLM's context limit
- **Pinned Elements:** User goals, safety boundaries, session theme
- **Priority Decay:** Deprioritize stale tokens unless reinforced

### B. Multi-Agent Context Sharing
- Shared planning thread with scoped permissions
- `ContextSlices` per agent role or task
- Shared `WorldState` where applicable (e.g., in governance, simulations)

---

## V. Ontology Evolution Protocol

### A. Update Triggers
- User defines new concept
- Agent encounters undefined term
- Plugin/module provides external schema

### B. Validation Steps
- Proposed concept stored in `staging_ontology`
- Validation by:
  - Trust-ranked agents
  - Human moderators (optional)
  - Logical consistency checks

### C. Merge Rules
- Avoid cycles or duplicate terms
- Preserve backward compatibility with aliases
- Use versioned ontology snapshots

---

## VI. Knowledge API Structure

### Endpoints
- `GET /ontology/entity/{id}`
- `POST /ontology/define`
- `GET /memory/context/{session_id}`
- `POST /memory/store`
- `GET /reasoning/trace/{task_id}`
- `POST /reasoning/plan`

### Formats
- **JSON-LD** for ontology
- **OpenAPI 3** for endpoint specs
- **Markdown/RDF** for human-readable ontologies

---

## VII. Security & Permissions

- Memory access governed by:
  - `MemoryAccessPolicy`
  - User profile scopes
  - Agent trust level
- Sensitive memory entries:
  - Encrypted at rest
  - Require elevated permission to view/modify
- All changes to knowledge graphs logged with actor + reason

---

## VIII. Visualization Tools

- **Knowledge Graph Viewer**
  - Node coloring by type (agent, task, tool, user)
  - Edge labels for relationship types
- **Reasoning Trace Explorer**
  - Timeline of reasoning steps
  - Success/failure analysis
- **Memory Browser**
  - Search + filter episodic logs
  - Show source, tags, expiration, scope
