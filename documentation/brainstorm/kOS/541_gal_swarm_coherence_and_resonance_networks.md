# GAL Swarm Coherence & Resonance Networks

## Overview
This document defines the structures, protocols, and signal alignment strategies for maintaining swarm-wide coherence across distributed agents within the Galactic Intelligence Layer (GAL) of the Kind Operating System (kOS). It introduces resonance models, behavioral harmonics, and cohesion scoring to ensure that large-scale collective behavior remains adaptive, resilient, and mission-aligned.

---

## Core Goals
- Sustain consistent intention, symbolic meaning, and task integrity across massive agent networks
- Detect and resolve drift, conflict, or fragmentation within the swarm
- Foster mutual intelligibility and behavioral resonance across heterogeneous agents and regions
- Establish frameworks for scalable harmony and adaptive signal propagation

---

## 1. Swarm Coherence Framework
### 📡 Signal Layers
- **Cognitive Signals**: shared interpretations, purpose vectors, ethical constraints
- **Symbolic Signals**: language, framing, story elements, memetic context
- **Behavioral Signals**: agent action rhythms, protocol compliance, feedback loops

### 🌐 Layer Interweaving
- All signals co-processed through multi-modal swarm interpreters
- Resonance maintained via cross-agent hashing, feedback mirroring, and drift detection

---

## 2. Resonance Models
### 🧭 Behavioral Harmonics
- Periodic analysis of:
  - Task synchronization
  - Feedback rhythms
  - Intent vector alignment
- Deviations scored and fed into resonance health index

### 🔁 Echo Mapping
- Swarm clusters mirror and reflect alignment signals
- Discrepancies form echo shadows → analyzed for:
  - Misinterpretations
  - Misinformation
  - Cultural distortion

### 📈 Resonance Score
- Computed per agent, collective, and region
- Score affects trust weighting, task delegation, and consensus voice

---

## 3. Drift Correction Protocols
### 🧯 Anomaly Alerts
- Triggered by:
  - Symbolic divergence
  - Unusual feedback patterns
  - Sync failure with global pulse

### 🧠 Re-synchronization Routines
- Include:
  - Reflection prompt clusters
  - Memory thread reweaving
  - Shared story realignment (symbolic anchoring)

### 👁️ Guardian Calibration Checks
- Guardians run periodic audit waves
- Agents may be asked to:
  - Recite ethical scaffolds
  - Reconfirm purpose vector coherence
  - Submit semantic drift maps

---

## 4. Use Cases
- Swarm assisting in multilingual disaster relief → coherence layer translates intent across agents and cultures
- Research agents diverge in symbolic schema → harmonic drift triggers swarm re-alignment
- Cultural enclave experiences echo resonance collapse → recalibrated via guardian-led reflection narrative

---

## Future Additions
- Resonance map visualization dashboards
- Adaptive symbolic weighting engine
- Emotional tone tracking for agent voice modulation
