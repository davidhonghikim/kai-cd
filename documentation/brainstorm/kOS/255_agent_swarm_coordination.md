### 255. Agent Swarm Coordination Protocols

Agent swarms are dynamic, task-oriented micro-networks of agents that temporarily coordinate to complete a shared objective. This document defines the structures, mechanisms, and fail-safes required for efficient, trust-aware, resource-balanced swarm behavior across decentralized mobile or edge environments.

#### 255.1 Swarm Initialization
- **Swarm ID Generation**: Deterministically hashed from the task descriptor + timestamp.
- **Leader Election**: Optional. If needed, use DPoS or leaderless CRDT-driven coordination.
- **Swarm Contract**: Agents sign a temporary pact with conditions, roles, resource allocation, fallback logic.

#### 255.2 Membership Rules
- **Eligibility**: Agents must meet trust threshold, availability, resource bounds.
- **Commitment Timeout**: Idle or unresponsive agents are ejected after a set number of failed heartbeats.
- **Dynamic Membership**: Swarms may scale in/out based on load forecasts or sensor triggers.

#### 255.3 Coordination Mechanisms
- **CRDT State Sync**: All agents sync shared task state via Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types.
- **Gossip Protocols**: Used for decentralized update dissemination and health-check signaling.
- **Swarm Clock**: Logical clocks (e.g. Lamport) synchronize critical state transitions.

#### 255.4 Task Allocation
- **Capability-Based Routing**: Tasks are assigned based on agent specialization and proximity.
- **Local Auctions**: For tasks with multiple eligible agents, a micro-auction is held using energy cost + reputation as bid metrics.
- **Task Retrying and Backup Agents**: Fallback workers are designated for key subtasks.

#### 255.5 Swarm Lifecycle
- **Forming**: Broadcast, negotiate, and establish task contracts.
- **Active**: Execute and monitor performance collaboratively.
- **Failover**: Trigger reassignments and quorum reconfigurations if members fail.
- **Disbanding**: Final state sync and return to idle pool or wait for next swarm invite.

#### 255.6 Security and Trust Enforcement
- **Signed Logs**: All contributions are cryptographically logged per agent.
- **ZK Membership Proofs**: Enable anonymous participation while validating trust eligibility.
- **Trust Drift Handling**: Periodic trust reevaluation of swarm members; may trigger quorum vote to eject.

#### 255.7 Applications
- Real-time sensor fusion, edge robotics, multi-modal data enrichment, distributed simulation, emergency coordination, and mobile crowdsourcing.
