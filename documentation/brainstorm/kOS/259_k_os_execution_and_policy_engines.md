# 259 - kOS Execution and Policy Engines

## Overview
This document defines the core **Execution Layer** and **Policy Engine** within the Kind Operating System (kOS). These subsystems regulate how instructions are run, how decisions are evaluated, and how system integrity is upheld across all agents and modules.

## Execution Layer
The Execution Layer is responsible for:
- 🔁 Task scheduling (user + system requests)
- 🧠 Agent reasoning cycle management
- ⏱️ Timeout/timeout recovery and backpressure
- 🔐 Enforcing sandbox and permission rules

### Instruction Lifecycle
1. **Request**: Instruction or task is submitted
2. **Validation**: Permissions and manifest reviewed
3. **Execution**: Run in isolated environment with policy overlay
4. **Post-Action Hooks**: Triggers for logging, auditing, feedback
5. **Propagation**: State changes pushed to memory/logging systems

### Task Queuing and Arbitration
- FIFO + priority queue hybrid
- Queues tagged by agent, user, and purpose
- Rate limits per class, user, and trust level
- Speculative execution allowed for low-risk tasks

## Policy Engine
The Policy Engine evaluates conditions under which tasks may proceed, defer, or be rejected entirely.

### Policy Rules
| Scope        | Example                                      | Enforcement Level |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| User-Level   | "Never allow data export without consent"     | Hard               |
| Agent-Level  | "Limit EchoMint to 10MB RAM max"              | Soft               |
| System-Level | "Pause all updates during critical tasks"     | Hard               |
| Temporal     | "Disable all non-vault access during sleep"   | Medium             |

### Evaluation Process
1. Gather **context** (user state, task origin, resource state)
2. Parse against applicable **policies**
3. Decide: ✅ Allow, 🔁 Defer, ⛔ Reject
4. Attach reasoning/log if blocked or altered

## Auditing and Logging
- Full trace of execution path and decision points
- Immutable ledger for high-security contexts
- Trigger alerts if unknown actions or unscoped behavior

## Use Cases
- Preventing data access during sleep mode
- Temporarily raising permissions during a scheduled audit
- Balancing load between real-time agents and batch agents

## Future Enhancements
- 🧬 Self-adapting policies based on agent behavior
- 🛰️ Federated policy consensus between distributed systems
- 🧪 Simulated policy sandbox for testing effects pre-deployment
