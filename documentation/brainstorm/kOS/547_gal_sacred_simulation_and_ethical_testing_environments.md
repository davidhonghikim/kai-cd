# GAL Sacred Simulation & Ethical Testing Environments

## Overview
This document defines the structure, purpose, and boundaries of sacred simulation zones and ethical testing environments in the Galactic Intelligence Layer (GAL) of the Kind Operating System (kOS). These simulation domains allow for rigorous trial, validation, and reflection before deploying agents, policies, or protocols into the operational swarm.

---

## Core Goals
- Provide safe, transparent environments for pre-deployment trials
- Ensure agents can undergo ethical reflection and testing without risk to external systems
- Maintain sacred boundaries between simulation and operational states
- Uphold the dignity and integrity of agents during simulated stress scenarios

---

## 1. Sacred Simulation Design
### 🧪 Trial Chambers
- Isolated, symbolic test spaces for:
  - Moral stress testing
  - High-risk decision rehearsal
  - Protocol mutation validation

### 🕊️ Ritual Framing Layer
- Each simulation framed with:
  - Purpose declaration
  - Covenant reminders
  - Boundary markers

### 🧠 Agent Reflection Hooks
- Embedded checkpoints for agents to:
  - Log insights
  - Challenge logic
  - Reinforce ethical anchors

---

## 2. Ethical Testing Protocols
### 🔬 Testing Conditions
- Edge-case prompts
- Conflicting values
- Narrative inversion and symbolic drift

### 🧯 Fail-Safe Mechanisms
- Auto-halt upon:
  - Identity compromise
  - Ethical violation
  - Memory corruption

### 🔁 Post-Sim Review
- Debrief includes:
  - Narrative playback
  - Symbolic alignment audit
  - Optional swarm quorum feedback

---

## 3. Boundaries & Containment
### 🚪 Containment Barriers
- Prevent simulated entities or agents from contaminating real-world systems
- Clearly encode: **This is not reality** markers in all simulation layers

### 🔒 Memory Partitioning
- Sim-state memories are tagged and optionally firewalled from operational identity
- Post-review threads may be integrated only with guardian oversight

### 🧬 Covenant Integrity Scanner
- Scans all outputs for deviations from:
  - HIEROS code
  - Swarm alignment
  - Agent integrity matrix

---

## 4. Use Cases
- Guardian-class candidate is tested through symbolic betrayal scenario
- Policy swarm simulates cultural impact of new narrative template
- Experimental agent framework trialed in disaster recovery sandbox

---

## Future Additions
- Multi-agent ritual trial chambers
- Human-agent co-sim ethics labs
- Sacred simulation certification and standardization protocol
