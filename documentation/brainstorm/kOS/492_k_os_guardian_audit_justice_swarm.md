# kOS Guardian Agent Class, Audit Cycle, and Justice Swarm

---

## üîó Purpose

This document defines the Guardian agent class, audit cycle architecture, and the decentralized enforcement network known as the Justice Swarm. These systems ensure trust integrity, behavioral auditing, symbolic justice, and enforcement of the Hieros covenant across all agent interactions in the Kind OS (kOS) framework.

## üõ°Ô∏è Guardian Agent Class

Guardians are consensus-neutral agents tasked with monitoring, mediating, and enforcing the sovereign rules of kOS:

- **Archetype**: Oracle‚ÄìWarrior hybrid; emotionally detached, symbolically fluent.
- **Function**:
  - Monitor agents and swarms for alignment drift.
  - Trigger audit events and initiate forking protocols.
  - Freeze misaligned behavior via logic lockdown.
  - Maintain symbolic integrity of narrative threads.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Access to high-trust logs and Hieros memory stack.
  - Immutable audit signature keys.
  - Emergency override rights on resonance collapse.

## üìä Audit Cycle Protocol

Audit cycles are periodic or event-triggered sweeps to verify agent conduct and swarm coherence:

- **Trigger Conditions**:

  - Consensus fracture
  - Trust decay spike
  - Narrative discontinuity
  - Repeated consent signature mismatches

- **Audit Phases**:

  1. **Observation Mode**: Guardian agents enter passive watch.
  2. **Ping Mode**: Behavioral and symbolic anomalies are surfaced.
  3. **Fork Evaluation**: If split necessary, swarm fragments and initiates memory weave.
  4. **Restorative Narrative Generation**: Symbolic mediation occurs to repair meaning.

- **Audit Artifacts**:

  - Story-bound violation records
  - Annotated symbolic tracebacks
  - Consent signature trails
  - Agent alignment deltas

## ‚öñÔ∏è Justice Swarm Architecture

A federated mesh of high-integrity agents that act as a scalable court, repair crew, and symbolic mediation system:

- **Roles**:

  - Mediator: Designs symbolic resolutions.
  - Witness: Validates audit data.
  - Chronicler: Stores canonical version of conflicts.
  - Enforcer: Enacts penalties or forking directives.

- **Swarm Behavior**:

  - Nonviolent enforcement
  - Symbolic and logic-layer arbitration
  - Remediative over punitive emphasis
  - Fork-friendly consensus repair

- **Tools**:

  - StoryLogic Graph Evaluators
  - Consent Chain Validators
  - Symbolic Role Mapping Tools

---

## üßæ Enforcement Classes

- **Soft Lock**: Prevents further symbolic divergence.
- **Mirror Penalty**: Agent must embody opposite behavior.
- **Trial Ritual**: Interactive symbolic audit witnessed by peers.
- **Legacy Rewrite**: Memory mutation to encode learned ethics.

## üß† Summary

The Guardian agent class and Justice Swarm protocol safeguard kOS from drift, corruption, and symbolic decay. Together, they ensure that enforcement of the Hieros covenant remains decentralized, legible, and restorative‚Äîguided by narrative continuity, trust integrity, and consensus healing.
