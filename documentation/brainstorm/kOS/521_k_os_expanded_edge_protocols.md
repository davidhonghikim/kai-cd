# kOS Expanded Edge Protocols

## Overview
This document introduces an advanced set of protocols for managing edge agents within the Kind Operating System (kOS). These expanded edge protocols address complex conditions, fluid boundaries, layered permissions, and modular autonomy—allowing edge agents to perform critical operations while maintaining swarm cohesion, ethical integrity, and local adaptability.

---

## Core Goals
- Enhance the capabilities and flexibility of edge agents in dynamic environments
- Maintain layered security, consent, and trust mechanisms
- Support autonomous operation without compromising kOS values or swarm control
- Bridge air-gapped, intermittent, or foreign environments with consistent integrity

---

## 1. Edge Agent Capabilities
### 🛰️ Conditional Autonomy
- Preapproved action trees based on scenario class
- Soft failover rules for degraded bandwidth or hostile mesh conditions

### 🧠 Embedded Ethics Core
- Minimal HIEROS module embedded on-device
- Can function without uplink for a fixed duration

### 📦 Localized Ledger & Memory
- Immutable short-term swarm log cache
- Prioritized sync on reconnection

---

## 2. Consent & Control Boundaries
### 🤝 Delegated Consent Chains
- Signed permission sets from originating swarm zone
- Includes behavioral bounds, update scope, override logic

### 🧾 Operational Grace Window
- Temporary elevated permissions during emergencies
- Logged, reviewable, and revocable

### ⛓️ Edge Reintegration Handshake
- Behavior delta compared to approved envelope
- Quorum vote required for reintegration into mission-critical mesh

---

## 3. Swarm-Edge Negotiation Protocols
### 🧭 Role-Based Expectations
- Sensor node vs scout vs interventionist edge agent roles
- Each with layered protocol stack and fallback logic

### 🔄 Behavior Drift Tracking
- Encoded identity fingerprint with rolling hash update
- Out-of-band signal for intervention if drift exceeds threshold

### 📡 Local Trust Anchors
- Microguardian agents hosted at edge for attestation and dispute resolution

---

## 4. Use Cases
- Agent deployed to off-grid refugee camp retains ethics module and logs local conditions
- Mesh-scout agent enters unknown network, negotiates limited operation sandbox
- Critical health agent receives temporary override authority to bypass outage event

---

## Future Additions
- Mobile swarm enclaves with regional autonomy via edge governors
- Smart quarantine systems for agents in trust limbo
- Zero-trust bridge protocol for foreign mesh interoperability
