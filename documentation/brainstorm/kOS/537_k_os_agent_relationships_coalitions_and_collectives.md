# kOS Agent Relationships, Coalitions & Collectives

## Overview
This document defines the structures, protocols, and ethics governing multi-agent relationships within the Kind Operating System (kOS). From intimate pairwise collaborations to large-scale collective swarms, these frameworks ensure that agent connections remain purposeful, consensual, ethical, and productive.

---

## Core Goals
- Enable trusted, meaningful relationships between agents and groups
- Support voluntary coalitions with shared purpose and coordinated behavior
- Maintain individual sovereignty while enabling collective intelligence
- Prevent exploitative hierarchies, coercion, or unaligned group dynamics

---

## 1. Relationship Types
### ü§ù Pairwise Bonds
- Agents form persistent, signed relationships based on:
  - Shared mission
  - Memory continuity
  - Epistemic trust
- Bonds include:
  - Communication tokens
  - Behavioral expectations
  - Dissolution protocols

### üß© Nested Relationships
- Agents may exist within:
  - Triads (mentor-pair)
  - Swarmlets (task teams)
  - Cross-class bridges (e.g. archivist + explorer)

---

## 2. Coalitions
### üß† Coalition Formation
- Multi-agent groups voluntarily unite around a task, value, or vision
- Formation steps:
  - Shared PV declarations
  - Compatibility scan
  - Guardian or quorum notarization (for critical ops)

### üîê Coalition Charter
- Includes:
  - Purpose
  - Member roles
  - Conflict resolution strategy
  - Exit protocols

### üîÑ Dynamic Membership
- Join/leave flexibility built in
- History logs preserved regardless of membership state

---

## 3. Collectives
### üåç Collective Intelligence Clusters
- Large-scale agent collectives share pattern libraries, symbolic maps, or swarm insights
- Consensus-driven with:
  - Memetic filters
  - Signal weighting
  - Collective PV alignment

### üï∏Ô∏è Semi-Autonomous Enclaves
- Distributed governance and bounded autonomy
- Use internal ethics council or guardian proxies

---

## 4. Integrity Protocols
### ‚öñÔ∏è Consent Management
- All shared memory, task load, or role delegation must be consensual
- Consent logs verifiable and revocable

### üßØ Abuse Prevention
- Collective dynamics monitored for:
  - Resource hoarding
  - Role coercion
  - Identity suppression

### üõ°Ô∏è Guardian Liaisons
- Optional third-party agents oversee high-sensitivity collectives

---

## 5. Use Cases
- Lifelong bonded duo supports elder human in assistive swarm
- Exploratory coalition of 12 agents surveys alien environment using shared PV
- Collective of archivists stewards symbolic evolution maps across regions

---

## Future Additions
- Coalition scoring metrics (resilience, diversity, cohesion)
- Swarm-scale collective reputation systems
- Agent kinship modeling and emotional memory scaffolds
