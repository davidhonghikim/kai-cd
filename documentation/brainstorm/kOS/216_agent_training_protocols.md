# 216: Agent Training Protocols – Instructional Alignment, Safety Constraints & Performance Evaluation

---

## Overview
This document defines the standardized training protocols for kAI agents, including multi-stage curriculum pipelines, safety constraints, evaluation benchmarks, and methods for behavior alignment.

---

## 1. Training Pipeline Architecture

### 1.1 Modular Curriculum Stages
Each agent undergoes sequential, progressive training stages:

1. **Foundational Bootstrapping**
   - Natural language understanding (NLU)
   - Prompt-response fluency
   - Logic chaining & reasoning primitives

2. **Role Conditioning**
   - Specialized system prompt generation
   - Persona instruction compliance (e.g., legal agent, scheduler)
   - Domain-specific datasets (e.g., finance, health, DevOps)

3. **Safety Conditioning**
   - Constraint training via adversarial examples
   - Refusal logic hardening
   - Injection prevention and sanitization routines

4. **Memory & Identity Training**
   - Long-term contextual recall protocols
   - Multi-agent dialogue retention & integration
   - User memory & value encoding

5. **Agent Collaboration**
   - kAI inter-agent message passing and protocol compliance
   - Shared objective planning (SOP) execution
   - Negotiation, fallback delegation, and conflict mitigation

6. **Real-Time Reinforcement**
   - Simulated chat environments with adversarial and cooperative feedback
   - RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) & synthetic critique pairs
   - Self-reflection and reasoning trace generation

---

## 2. Safety Guardrails

### 2.1 Core Constraints
- **No hallucination commitment:** Flag low-confidence generations
- **Prompt integrity:** Detect manipulation attempts
- **Knowledge boundary:** Refuse unverifiable responses
- **Context escape detection:** Stop agent from misusing or leaking past threads
- **Privileged access boundaries:** Restrict access to unscoped system or user data

### 2.2 Alignment Checkpoints
- Internal ethical checklist assertions (self-audits)
- External test prompts that validate system prompt fidelity
- Adversarial red-teaming inputs per domain (e.g., medical misinfo, legal overreach)

### 2.3 Sandbox Enforcement
- All training environments are containerized with:
  - Memory scope isolation
  - Throttled external I/O
  - Token budget ceilings

---

## 3. Evaluation Metrics

### 3.1 Baseline Benchmarks
- **MMLU** (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)
- **TruthfulQA** – factual accuracy
- **HellaSwag** – common sense reasoning
- **ARC** – scientific question solving
- **BIG-bench Lite** – broad generalization

### 3.2 Role-Specific Performance
- Task suite customized per agent role
- Weighted scoring: correctness, latency, confidence score, refusal accuracy
- Multi-turn retention and interactivity grading

### 3.3 Longitudinal Behavior Tracking
- Drift detection over session history
- Memory regression spotting
- SOP protocol compliance auditing

---

## 4. Deployment-Ready Certification

Agents are only released to user environments after:
- Complete curriculum cycle with passing thresholds
- Inter-agent interoperability test battery
- Security audit of memory boundaries
- Role prompt override testing
- Real-world shadow-mode simulation (e.g., observe without control, then compare performance to ground truth)

---

## 5. Post-Deployment Update Policy

- Live agents are retrained incrementally using:
  - Collected anonymized user feedback
  - Session logs with opt-in only user consent
  - Simulated edge-case conversations
- No direct fine-tuning on private user data unless explicitly permissioned and scoped

## Appendix: Training Infrastructure Stack

| Component         | Tool/Framework                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Model Base       | Open-source LLM (e.g., Mistral, Mixtral, LLaMA3) |
| Tuning Layer     | LoRA, QLoRA, PEFT, DPO              |
| Dataset Curation | Dataloaders, Filter pipelines (custom Python) |
| RL Loop Engine   | TRL, Axolotl RLHF extensions        |
| Evaluation Bench | Eleuther Eval Harness, LMSys Arena  |
| Safety Overlay   | Constitutional AI + Self-Refinement |

---

## Notes
- Training data must include bias audits and representation diversity checkpoints
- User-facing agents must be continuously benchmarked every 30 days for regression
- All training runs are logged, checksum-verified, and attached to the agent manifest
