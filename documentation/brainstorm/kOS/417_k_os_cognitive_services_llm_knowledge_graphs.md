# 417 - kOS Cognitive Services, LLM Layers, and Knowledge Graphs

## Overview
This document explores how cognitive services within the Kind Operating System (kOS) are structured, layered, and enhanced through large language models (LLMs), symbolic reasoning, and hyper-contextual knowledge graphs.

## Layered LLM Architecture
| Layer                  | Purpose                                                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 💬 Base Models             | Core LLMs for general-purpose reasoning, pre-trained across broad corpora         |
| 🧠 Contextual Agents       | Fine-tuned models aligned with specific user, domain, or agent class goals        |
| 🧩 Hybrid Composers        | Mix symbolic logic, search trees, and LLM predictions for deep reasoning          |
| 🛰️ Specialized Microbrains | Task- or device-specific LLMs with efficient architectures (TinyML, edge models)  |

## Knowledge Graphs
- 🕸️ Real-Time Semantic Graphs: Every agent maintains and updates a memory-resident graph of entities, claims, and references
- 🔗 Federated Graph Interlinking: Agents federate their graphs with others in trusted clusters or domains
- 🧬 Embedding Overlay: Graphs are indexed and enriched with embedding space projections for fast semantic similarity
- 📚 Provenance-Aware Nodes: All knowledge elements include source metadata, timestamp, confidence, and authorship

## Cognitive Services Modules
- 🔍 Search & Retrieval: Vector-aware semantic search across agent memory and public corpora
- 🎯 Task Planner: Multi-agent cognitive loop planner with self-assessment heuristics
- 🗺️ Navigation & Problem Solving: Embeds maps, workflows, playbooks, and decision trees
- 🧪 Simulators & Validators: Run simulations, test hypothetical plans, validate logic paths

## Integration Features
- 🔄 Live Memory Weaving: Shared memory and symbolic constructs across LLM and structured databases
- 🧠 Transferable Mental Models: Agents can export or import mental schema across missions or clusters
- 🪢 Intent Disambiguation: Natural language processed through context stack + symbolic intent handler
- 🧩 Modular Cognition Blocks: Developers can plug in their own reasoning engines or expert systems
