# 235: kOS Policy Registry

## Overview

The **kOS Policy Registry** is a central authority within the Kind OS ecosystem that maintains authoritative records of all recognized and distributed policy definitions. These policies govern AI agent behavior, system compliance, data handling, and user rights. It serves as the contract and terms registry used by agents and services to verify operational expectations.

---

## Purpose

- Maintain a distributed yet consistent ledger of approved, updated, and revoked policies.
- Facilitate agent compliance through verifiable policy hashes.
- Enable zero-trust negotiation by using signed policy claims.
- Provide APIs and tools for developers to define, submit, and update policies.
- Support interoperability between independently hosted instances of Kind OS.

---

## Key Features

### 🧩 Policy Versioning

- Policies are tracked via semantic versioning (e.g., `1.0.0`)
- Support for automatic deprecation notices and fallback behaviors
- Backward compatibility flags

### 📝 Structured Policy Format

Policies are stored as structured JSON/YAML objects, including:

- `id` (UUID or hash)
- `title`
- `version`
- `type`: behavior, privacy, security, access, etc.
- `issuer`: signer identity (can be organization or user)
- `scope`: applicable system or agent class
- `clauses[]`: list of atomic rules
- `signatures[]`: cryptographic proofs
- `enforcement_mode`: `soft`, `warn`, `strict`

### 🔐 Decentralized Signing

- Policy submissions must be signed using kOS DIDs and cryptographic keypairs
- Verifiable credential support via W3C standards
- Each policy can carry multiple endorsements from trusted nodes/DAOs

### 🧾 Ledger System

- Core registry runs on a verifiable append-only log (optional integration with blockchain)
- Can use Git + Sigstore or IPFS + CRDTs for decentralized syncing
- Merkle tree structure to ensure immutability

### 📡 Broadcast + Fetch APIs

- Pub/sub API to notify agents when policy changes
- Query API for filtering by scope, tag, version, etc.
- Compatibility with kLP (Kind Link Protocol) for pushing deltas

## Developer APIs

### `GET /policies`

Query registered policies.

- `?scope=agent.kAI`
- `?version=latest`
- `?tag=privacy`

### `POST /policies`

Submit new policy document (must include signature).

### `GET /policies/:id`

Fetch specific policy by hash or UUID.

### `POST /endorsements`

Allow a trusted agent/DAO to endorse an existing policy.

---

## Security Controls

- Policy execution engines perform hash checks on every enforcement cycle.
- Policy documents are verified with multi-signature chains.
- All submissions are timestamped, and invalidated hashes are stored for audit.
- Agents can preload and verify policies during boot via pre-signed Merkle root snapshots.

---

## Use Cases

- Agent onboarding: verify default operational policy set
- Medical AI deployments: enforce HIPAA or region-specific data laws
- Multimodal systems: apply safety constraints depending on interface type (chat vs camera)
- Data pipelines: enforce anonymization before vector indexing

---

## Integration

- Shared root with `kAI/trust_engine/`
- Syncs with `kOS/compliance_registry/`
- Interoperates with `kLP` broadcast modules

---

## Future Enhancements

- Web UI for policy browsing, comparisons, diff view
- DAO-based policy voting
- Zero-knowledge proof attestation for policy adherence
- Rust SDK for embedded agent platforms
