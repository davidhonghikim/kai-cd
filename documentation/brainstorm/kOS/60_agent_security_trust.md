# 60: Agent Security & Trust – Authentication, Sandboxing, and Quarantine Frameworks

This document provides full architectural and implementation details for secure agent runtime, identity, trust enforcement, permission layers, and containment models across the `kAI` and `kOS` platforms.

---

## I. Purpose

The Agent Security & Trust module ensures:

- Controlled execution of user and system agents
- Transparent permissions and escalation prevention
- Cryptographically enforced identity and origin tracing
- Agent lifecycle governance, quarantine, and accountability

---

## II. Directory Structure

    │   ├── AgentSandboxManager.ts      # Central interface for running and monitoring agents in isolation
    │   ├── VmRuntime.ts                # VM/container-based execution (e.g. Pyodide, Deno, or NodeVM)
    │   ├── AgentPolicyEngine.ts        # Runtime permission evaluator and role enforcer
    │   ├── CapabilityContext.ts        # Tracks what each agent is allowed to access
    │   └── QuarantineManager.ts        # Handles agents placed under restriction or review

    │   ├── TrustToken.ts               # Signed trust assertions and delegation certs
    │   └── ProofOfOrigin.ts            # Cryptographic tracing for agent code and source
    └── logs/
        ├── AgentAuditLog.ts            # Event logs for agent activity, violations, and sandbox state
        └── AlertHooks.ts               # Hooks for alerting or disabling on policy breach
```

## III. Agent Identity & Trust Tokens

### A. DID Model

- Each agent has a `did:kind:agentUUID`
- Linked to keypair (Ed25519)
- Can sign capabilities, runtime requests, and manifests

### B. TrustToken Structure

```ts
interface TrustToken {
  subject: DID;
  issuer: DID;
  issuedAt: string;
  expiresAt?: string;
  type: 'delegation' | 'capability' | 'attestation';
  claims: object;
  signature: string;
}
```

### C. Use Cases

- Delegating a UI agent to manage other agents
- Authorizing temporary elevated access for data migration
- Proving that a plugin came from a trusted developer

---

## IV. Sandboxing Execution

### A. Runtime Targets

- **Pyodide** for Python logic (browser-based WebAssembly)
- **NodeVM** for JavaScript agents
- **Deno Workers** with permissions
- **NSJail / Docker (kOS)** for isolated OS-level agents

### B. Policy Enforcement

```ts
const agentPolicy = {
  allowNetwork: false,
  allowFilesystem: false,
  maxExecutionTime: 5000,
  allowedApis: ['memory.get', 'prompt.submit'],
};
```

### C. Quarantine Conditions

- Invalid signature
- Expired delegation
- Blacklisted origin
- Behavior deviation (detected via watchdog)

Agents in quarantine can:

- Be blocked from launching
- Be isolated to temporary execution with logs
- Be flagged for review or approval

---

## V. Capability Scopes

Permissions are assigned as capabilities such as:

| Capability            | Description                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `read:memory`         | Read user or system memory entries       |
| `write:disk`          | Persist data to disk                     |
| `invoke:llm`          | Make LLM completion or embedding request |
| `delegate:agent`      | Spawn or command another agent           |
| `access:api:calendar` | Use user's calendar integration          |
| `shell:exec`          | Execute local shell commands (high risk) |

Agents are granted least-privilege scopes and escalations require:

- Explicit signed TrustToken delegation
- User approval (optionally remembered)
- Logged trace with undo hooks

---

## VI. Monitoring & Logs

- Every agent launch, action, and error is logged
- Logs signed and stored locally with optional encryption
- Audit trail exported in `JSONL`, `SIGLOG`, or Merkle Tree snapshot
- Optional real-time alerts via webhook or UI notifications

---

## VII. Tamper Detection & Proof-of-Origin

- SHA-256 hash of agent bundle
- Signed manifest proving origin repo, version, author
- Periodic recheck and revalidation on update
- Optional anchoring in decentralized ledger

---

## VIII. Integration Points

- Integrated with **KLP** (Kind Link Protocol) for DID, capability negotiation, and trust routing
- Plugged into **Prompt Manager**, **Orchestrator**, and **Vault** for boundary enforcement
- Hooks available for custom policy plugins per org or user

---

## IX. Governance Controls (Optional)

- Token- or trust-weighted voting on agent permission sets
- Escalation queues for sensitive agent launches
- Signed user policy bundles (e.g. "child mode", "dev mode")

---
