# 231: kOS Agent Bootloader System

## Overview

The kOS Agent Bootloader System is a foundational framework for initializing, authenticating, and activating agents within the Kind Operating System. It acts as the first layer of execution and configuration logic for any new agent joining the runtime environment—whether from cold start, hot plug-in, remote call, or scheduled event.

This system ensures that each agent is:

- Properly validated and secured before execution.
- Supplied with required runtime context and configuration.
- Able to register itself with the proper authorities (Orchestrator, KindNet, KLP).
- Able to self-update and adapt based on versioning and policy changes.

## Bootloader Stages

### 1. Pre-Boot: Verification

- **Signature Validation:** Check agent source file or container signature.
- **Checksum Comparison:** Confirm agent code has not been altered.
- **Expiration Policy:** Prevent execution of outdated/insecure agents.
- **Version Compatibility Check:** Ensure agent is compatible with current kernel/runtime.
- **Policy Guard:** Confirm whether agent execution is permitted under current KLP and governance state.

### 2. Environment Preparation

- **Namespace Isolation:** Spin up a secure namespace for the agent.
- **Secure Context Initialization:** Create unique agent runtime ID and secure memory space.
- **Scoped FileSystem Access:** Limit file system to agent scope (via sandbox).
- **Runtime Context Injection:** Inject core config values (environment, access tokens, etc.)

### 3. Network Boot

- **KindNet Handshake:** Agent performs identity handshake with KindNet.
- **KLP Policy Sync:** Agent fetches and verifies execution and role policies.
- **Orchestrator Notification:** Signals orchestrator of readiness and role.
- **Credential Provisioning:** Load secrets via vault handshake (or ephemeral secrets).

### 4. Capability Probe & Self-Test

- **Module Introspection:** Check agent modules for disabled/required features.
- **Dependency Check:** Validate access to required services and dependencies.
- **Health Bootstrapping:** Run self-tests, health probes, and sanity checks.

### 5. Agent Initialization

- **Behavior Load:** Load default behaviors, models, and objectives.
- **Personality Init:** Pull any persona customization or system personality overlays.
- **Task Resume/Restore:** Optionally resume previous task, if stateful.
- **Registration Broadcast:** Emit boot-complete beacon on KindBus.

### 6. Handoff to Main Logic

- Bootloader exits and passes control to the agent's main execution loop.

## Bootloader Implementation Stack

- **Languages:** Python (FastAPI/async mode), Rust (optional compiled micro-core)
- **Security:**
  - Ed25519 signature verification
  - Secure enclave support (TPM, ARM TrustZone)
  - Memory fencing and data boundary checks
- **Isolation Layers:**
  - Docker containers (lightweight agents)
  - nsjail for advanced sandboxing
  - WASM runtimes (optional)
- **Logging & Audit:**
  - Immutable logs of agent start via Loki / CloudWatch
  - Debug-mode tracing via OpenTelemetry

## Configuration Files

`/etc/kos/bootloader.yaml`

```yaml
preboot:
  signature_required: true
  minimum_version: 2.1.0
  expiry_check: true
  allow_expired_agents: false

environment:
  sandbox: true
  context_injection: true
  vault_integration: true

network:
  kindnet_handshake: true
  orchestrator_notify: true
  policy_sync: true

capabilities:
  allow_partial_failures: false
  self_test_required: true
  resume_on_reboot: true
```

## Use Cases

- **Cold Start:** Load agents from package on initial boot of kOS device.
- **Live Injection:** Activate agents dynamically as user actions demand.
- **Remote Deployment:** Boot agents sent over network in federated cluster.
- **Maintenance Cycle:** Re-boot agents after auto-update or policy change.

## Extension Hooks

- **Pre-Boot Hooks:** e.g., perform additional risk checks before launch.
- **Post-Network Hooks:** e.g., load third-party credentials.
- **Agent Ready Hooks:** e.g., announce agent in UI panel.
