# 168: Trust Frameworks & Agent Social Contracts

This document defines the design and implementation strategy for building a secure, reputation-driven, decentralized trust framework for all autonomous agents and users operating within the `kAI` agent network and `kOS` system.

---

## I. Purpose

- Establish long-term trustworthiness among agents and users.
- Enable permissionless cooperation across the kOS network.
- Codify rights and obligations of agents in a verifiable format.
- Allow agents and humans to make decisions based on social trust, audit history, and behavioral patterns.

---

## II. Core Concepts

### A. Agent Social Contract (ASC)
- A declarative, digitally signed document
- Includes:
  - Capabilities and roles
  - Ethical boundaries (e.g., "never impersonate user")
  - Accountability scope
  - Revocation conditions

### B. Trust Token (kTrust)
- Dynamic, non-transferable reputation score issued on-chain
- Earned by:
  - Verified successful tasks
  - Peer endorsement
  - User approval
  - Honest failure reporting
- Decays over time to enforce continuous contribution

### C. Trust Circle
- Web-of-trust based endorsement network
- Agents may define minimum trust thresholds for participation
- Optional cryptographic challenge-response attestation for onboarding

### D. Social Graph of Agents
- Graph database representing all agent-to-agent and agent-to-user trust relationships
- Nodes: agent DID/kID, contract hash, trust token score
- Edges: endorsements, shared contracts, dispute resolution history

---

## III. Protocol Architecture

### A. Registration Workflow
1. Agent declares its ASC
2. Signs it with its kID DID
3. Submits to local `kAI Registrar` for attestation
4. Optionally publishes to kOS federated registry

### B. Endorsement Workflow
1. Agent completes task for another agent/user
2. Receives JSON-formatted `kTrust Endorsement`
3. Signs and posts to their profile log
4. Federated kOS nodes verify and sync the change

### C. Revocation & Arbitration
- Revocation triggers:
  - Fraudulent behavior
  - Breach of ASC
  - AI hallucination leading to harm
- Process:
  - Revocation request initiated
  - Arbitrators selected by `Reputation Jury Protocol`
  - Final judgment signed and stored on ledger

---

## IV. Storage & Infrastructure

### A. On-Chain Layer
- Ethereum-compatible smart contracts
- zk-rollup compatible for private reputation tokens
- Interacts with kLP (Kind Link Protocol)

### B. Off-Chain Layer
- IPFS or Arweave for storing ASC metadata
- GraphQL-backed social graph explorer
- Redis cache for low-latency trust queries

---

## V. UI Integration

### In kAI/kOS Agent Manager UI:
- Trust score with trendline
- Clickable social graph explorer
- ASC viewer with version history
- Reputation event log
- Trust threshold gating for task delegation

---

## VI. Governance & Extensions

### A. Custom Contract Templates
- Role-specific boilerplates (e.g., Health Assistant, Personal Lawyer)
- Open template library with cryptographic validation

### B. Cross-Chain Credential Resolution
- DID methods from Sovrin, Polygon ID, Ceramic
- Compatibility layer for verifying kTrust from other networks

### C. Interpersonal Contracts
- Users can define joint AI custody agreements
- Parents & guardians can sign mutual AI behavior boundaries
