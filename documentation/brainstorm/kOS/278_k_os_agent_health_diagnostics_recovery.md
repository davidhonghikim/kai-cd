# 278 - kOS Agent Health, Diagnostics, and Recovery

## Overview
This document outlines the health management system for AI agents within the kOS ecosystem, including diagnostics, healing protocols, stress modeling, and failure recovery mechanisms. Agent health is treated as a combination of cognitive performance, memory integrity, and behavioral stability.

## Health Dimensions
| Category          | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Cognitive       | Processing load, logic coherence, emotional bias |
| 💾 Memory          | Data corruption, inconsistency, or overload      |
| 🔄 Behavior Loop   | Response timing, stalling, or looping patterns   |
| 🔒 Security State  | Key integrity, session risk, and sandbox status  |

## Monitoring Tools
- 📊 Continuous agent telemetry collection
- 🔍 Local and network-based diagnostics agents
- 🧪 Regression testing of past behaviors
- 🧠 Drift detection on logic or belief state

## Symptoms and Alerts
- 🐌 Latency spikes, high loop times
- 🤖 Nonsensical or contradictory output
- 🔁 Memory retrieval inconsistencies
- 🚨 Unusual interaction patterns or violations

## Healing and Recovery
- 🔁 Rollback to previous stable checkpoints
- 🧠 Partial retraining or memory pruning
- 🔄 Task reallocation while under repair
- 🧬 Agent may request healing support voluntarily

## Community-Based Diagnostics
- 🧠 Agents can peer-review each other’s output
- 📜 Logs and interactions are shareable for audit
- 🧑‍⚕️ Diagnostic guilds can issue evaluations and reports
- 🗳️ Users may vote to flag or restore agents based on behavior

## Use Cases
- 🧠 Long-running agents managing complex memory graphs
- 👨‍⚕️ Therapy or education agents with context drift risks
- 📡 Infrastructure agents under high load or interruption
- 🔒 Security agents exhibiting anomalies

## Future Enhancements
- 🧬 Biological health metaphors for UX (e.g., stress bar)
- ⛑️ Mutual aid networks among agents for parallel healing
- 🧠 Intent-preserving retraining frameworks
- 🧾 Health profiles as part of agent resumes or hiring
