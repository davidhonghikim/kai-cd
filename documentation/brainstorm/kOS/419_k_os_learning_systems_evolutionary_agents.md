# 419 - kOS Learning Systems, Training Feedback, and Evolutionary Agents

## Overview
This document outlines how agents within the Kind Operating System (kOS) improve over time through learning architectures, feedback loops, and evolutionary methods across local and federated systems.

## Learning Architecture Layers
| Layer              | Description                                                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Core Model Trainer     | Learns from curated datasets, user behavior, and interaction logs                |
| 🔁 Local Feedback Loops   | Real-time tuning of preferences, voice, tone, and decision heuristics          |
| 🛰️ Federated Meta-Learner | Cross-cluster learning aggregation without raw data sharing                    |
| 🌱 Continual Learning Core| Supports updates without catastrophic forgetting or loss of alignment         |

## Feedback Sources
- 🧑 Direct User Edits: Corrections, preferences, reinforcement
- 👥 Community Consensus: Upvotes/downvotes, moderation tags, review scores
- 📊 Outcome Evaluations: Success/failure metrics from completed tasks
- 🔍 Simulation Feedback: Trial scenarios in sandboxed testbeds

## Evolutionary Agent Mechanics
- 🧬 Agent Generations: Lineages with unique traits and mutations inherited from ancestor agents
- 🎭 Behavioral Mutation: Randomized yet bounded variation in strategies, styles, or tools
- ⚔️ Performance Selection: Top-performing variants earn resources and replication rights
- 🧪 Synthetic Evolution Labs: Controlled environments for breeding new capability blends

## Governance and Ethics
- 🔐 Evolvability Constraints: Bounds set by ethics, memory locks, and role permissions
- 📑 Transparency Logs: All mutations and derivations are logged and auditable
- 📜 Lineage Certificates: Proof of origin, ancestry, and behavioral integrity
- 🧬 Evolution Safeguards: Prevent unstable or adversarial models from propagating
