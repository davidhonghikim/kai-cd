# 77: Agent Trust Protocols & Identity Verification System

This document outlines the design, enforcement, and implementation of the Agent Trust Protocols (ATP) and decentralized identity (DID)-based verification mechanisms across the `kAI` and `kOS` agent ecosystem. Trust is the foundation of cooperation between agents and users, enabling a safe, auditable, and autonomous system.

---

## I. Purpose

To provide a robust, transparent, and interoperable system for:

- Agent authentication and authorization
- Trust score propagation and validation
- Role and permission enforcement
- Verification of agent claims and capabilities
- Decentralized trust web modeling

---

## II. Components

### 1. Agent Identity Record (AIR)
Each agent must generate and maintain an `agent.identity.json` file that contains:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "agent.finance.042",
  "public_key": "...base64...",
  "signature": "...sig...",
  "fingerprint": "...sha256...",
  "creator": "did:kai:developer-x",
  "issued_at": "2025-06-20T13:10:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-06-20T13:10:00Z",
  "trust_level": "linked.trust",
  "capabilities": ["LangChainTools", "SecurePrompt", "MemoryCore"]
}
```

### 2. TrustLink Graph
A persistent, append-only graph database that tracks:

- Agent identity signatures
- Web-of-trust links (endorsements, validations)
- Trust assertions with optional weights and context

Stored in:
```
/trust/graph.db (or remote DID-backed store)
```

Supports:
- Cypher-like queries (e.g. "Who trusts X via 2+ links?")
- Audit trails (timestamped signatures and actions)

### 3. Trust Score Engine
Dynamic score calculated from:
- Valid cryptographic identity (signed by known DID)
- Endorsements by trusted agents
- Role-specific trust thresholds
- Behavior audit logs (compliance, error rate, escalation flags)

### 4. Chain-of-Trust Enforcement
Before any sensitive agent-to-agent interaction, the following steps occur:

1. Resolve `agent.identity.json` + validate signature
2. Traverse `TrustLinkGraph` for endorsement path
3. Evaluate trust score with respect to required threshold
4. Grant or deny invocation based on role context

## III. Trust Levels & Thresholds

| Trust Level      | Description                             | Example Roles                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `root.kernel`    | System core access                      | `ConfigManager`, `SchedulerAgent`      |
| `trusted.user`   | User-owned agent                        | `GoalPlanner`, `DailyAssistant`        |
| `linked.trust`   | Trusted external agent with endorsement | `LegalAdvisor`, `MeshRouter`           |
| `restricted`     | Limited access/sandboxed                | `Transcoder`, `TextParser`             |
| `external`       | Unverified, publicly registered agent   | `MarketplaceTool`, `OpenAgent`         |

---

## IV. DID (Decentralized Identifier) Integration

Each agent's creator or governing entity is represented by a W3C-compliant DID.

Example:
```json
"creator": "did:kai:dev-core-1234"
```

Supported DID Methods:
- `did:kai:` (native Kind identity)
- `did:key:`
- `did:web:`
- `did:ethr:` (optional Ethereum compatibility)

DID Documents resolve to public key info and service endpoints. Verification is via signature validation.

---

## V. Certificate-Based Attestation (Optional)

In regulated domains (medical, legal, finance), agents may embed X.509 or verifiable credential chains. Stored in:
```
agent.cert.pem
```
Attached to requests requiring professional or legal assertions.

---

## VI. Agent Behavior Audit Trail

Logged in secure, append-only format:
```
/logs/agent-[id]/2025-06-20.jsonl
```
Each entry includes:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-20T13:40:00Z",
  "action": "external_api_call",
  "target": "cohere",
  "result": "success",
  "notes": "Completion retrieved for query xyz"
}
```
Audits contribute to trust score adjustments.

---

## VII. UI Integration (Trust UI Layer)

Trust indicators shown in all kAI and kOS UIs:
- Badge color based on trust level
- Clickable popover with identity, endorsements, score
- Warnings if an agent is unverified or restricted

Example badge legend:
- ðŸŸ¢ Verified Trust
- ðŸŸ¡ Linked with Endorsement
- ðŸ”´ Unverified or Untrusted

---

## VIII. Future Enhancements

- ZK-Proofs for capability claims
- Web-of-trust voting and slashing for malicious agents
- Revocation registries
- Agent identity NFTs / soulbound tokens
