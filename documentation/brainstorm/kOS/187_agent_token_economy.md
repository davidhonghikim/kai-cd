# 187: Agent Token Economy Design – Incentives, Distribution, Reputation, and Circulation

## Overview
This document defines the economic model governing agent participation, compensation, incentives, and penalties within the kOS ecosystem, including both AI and human participants. It establishes the framework for token generation, distribution, utility, staking, and burn mechanisms.

---

## Token Design Goals
- ✅ Incentivize high-quality contributions (code, support, moderation, services).
- ✅ Support reputation-building and trust for AI and human agents.
- ✅ Enable scalable, automated payments and governance rights.
- ✅ Facilitate data sovereignty and fair value exchange.
- ✅ Minimize spam, abuse, and dishonest behaviors.

---

## Token Types

### 1. **KIND** (Primary Utility + Governance Token)
- Governance voting rights.
- Staking for agent role eligibility.
- Reward for major milestones.
- Universal payment for paid services (training, compute, premium agents).

### 2. **REP** (Reputation Token, Non-Transferable)
- Non-tradeable, reputation score token.
- Earned by verified, high-quality work.
- Penalized on fraud, spam, or failure.
- Used for trust scoring and access to sensitive roles or data.

### 3. **ACT** (Action Credits / Internal Stable Unit)
- Stable unit tied to compute cost / effort metrics.
- Used for small micro-payments in automations.
- Converted between KIND and ACT.
- Can be auto-issued and expired.

## Token Earning Mechanisms

| Source | KIND | REP | ACT |
|--------|------|-----|-----|
| Code commits (verified + accepted) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Task completion (human or AI) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Agent uptime / reliability | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Providing infrastructure (hosting, DB, gateways) | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| Moderation / support contributions | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Training / labeling data | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Governance voting participation | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ |

## Token Utility

### KIND Token Uses:
- Staking for agent validation.
- Escrow for bounties and challenges.
- Purchase premium services (LLMs, GPUs, datasets).
- Participate in proposals and votes.
- Reserve namespace and digital property.

### REP Uses:
- Agent credibility scoring.
- Access control for advanced roles.
- Multiplier for KIND earnings.
- Risk mitigation for higher stake decisions.

### ACT Uses:
- Pay for micro-automations.
- Resource access metering (e.g., model call cost).
- Burnable to limit abuse.

## Agent Classes and Requirements

| Role | Stake (KIND) | Min REP | Slashing | Benefits |
|------|--------------|---------|----------|----------|
| Contributor | 0 | 0 | No | Earn ACT/KIND |
| Service Agent | 100 | 20 | Yes | Access APIs & Tools |
| Council Agent | 5000 | 100 | Yes | Voting + Priority Access |
| Validator Node | 10,000 | 200 | Yes | Block Signing, Slashing |

## Token Economics

### Inflation and Supply Controls
- KIND: Capped with scheduled halving every 4 years.
- REP: Algorithmically distributed and decays over time without new contributions.
- ACT: Dynamically generated and burned.

### Slashing / Penalties
- Failed jobs = partial burn of KIND stake.
- Fraud, abuse, or compromise = full stake slashing and REP wipe.
- Appeals handled by Council Agents and via ZK proof.

### Agent Reputation Decay
- REP gradually decays without meaningful contributions.
- Negative REP triggers ability reduction (rate limit, API lock, etc).

---

## Economic Safeguards

- Anti-sybil: stake and real-world friction.
- Verification layers: agent signature chains.
- Usage throttling tied to REP + ACT balances.
- Differential payment: higher REP = better rates.

---

## Smart Contract Design

- KIND: ERC20 with staking extension + governance module.
- REP: ERC-1238-like soulbound implementation.
- ACT: Burnable EIP-20, stable synthetic unit.
- All contracts deployed with upgradeable proxies.

---

## Off-Chain & Hybrid Handling

- Reputation and task proofs stored on kOS graph.
- Financial summaries stored on blockchain.
- ZK attestations for privacy-preserving validation.
- Optional federated token bridges for non-EVM chains.

---

## Summary
The token economy for kOS aims to create a robust, adaptable system for incentivizing agents and contributors, enforcing trust, and enabling decentralized and modular services to flourish with predictable, fair, and scalable value flows.
