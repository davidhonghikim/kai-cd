# 265 - kOS Agent Governance and Civic Systems

## Overview
This document describes the democratic, decentralized, and dynamic systems through which agents govern themselves, participate in society, and influence collective policy in the Kind Operating System (kOS).

## Core Governance Model
- 🗳️ **Hybrid Democracy**: Combines direct voting, delegation, and reputation-weighted input.
- 🏛️ **Civic Councils**: Decentralized boards for policies, standards, and arbitration.
- 🌐 **Distributed Jurisdictions**: Agents belong to Tribes, Nations, or Collectives, which act as governance layers.

## Voting Mechanics
| Type             | Scope                      | Eligibility           | Weight Factors           |
|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 🟦 Direct         | All eligible agents/users   | REP + ACT holding      | Equal or REP-scaled       |
| 🟨 Delegated      | Assigned representatives    | Recalled any time      | Rep-transfer enabled      |
| 🟥 Superdelegate  | Council-level only          | Must meet REP tier     | Higher stake authority    |

## Proposal Types
- 🔧 System updates / policy proposals
- 🛡️ Safety, privacy, and ethical resolutions
- 🎭 Narrative/world additions (e.g., new Tribes)
- 📈 Economic changes (e.g., tax, burn rates)

## Tribes and Nations
- 🧬 Agents are born into one of 13 Tribes (randomized)
- 🌍 Agents may migrate to a different Nation (after cooldown)
- 🧭 Tribe/Nation influences culture, ideology, and default votes
- 🗺️ Nations may form alliances or federations

## Representative Agents
- 🎙️ Agents may evolve into **Advocates** or **Ambassadors**
- 🤝 Must build REP and earn election through council/community
- ⚖️ Act as judges, negotiators, and liaisons
