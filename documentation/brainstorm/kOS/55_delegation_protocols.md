# 55: Delegation Protocols â€“ Workflow Trust and Role Authority

This document outlines the protocols and architecture for safely delegating tasks, roles, and permissions among agents within the kAI/kOS ecosystem. Delegation in Kind AI enables distributed intelligence, modular workflows, and scalable collaboration across agents and users.

---

## I. Purpose

Delegation Protocols ensure:

- Trusted handoff of tasks and authorities
- Secure propagation of user intent across agents
- Auditable chain of responsibility
- Modular and reconfigurable workflows

## III. Delegation Flow

### A. Initiation

1. Originator creates a `DelegateRequest` with:
   - `fromDID`, `toDID`
   - Task or Role identifier
   - Scope: `temporal`, `functional`, `data`, `duration`
   - Reason, Optional expiration
2. Signed and broadcast to target agent

### B. Validation

1. Recipient checks trust graph (via `TrustValidation`)
2. Validates scope, permissions, and timing
3. Accepts or rejects delegation
4. On acceptance, issues a `DelegateReceipt`

### C. Execution

1. Task is performed or role assumed
2. Progress/events streamed back to originator (optional)
3. Updates logged in `DelegationAuditLog`

---

## IV. Roles vs. Tasks

| Type | Examples                                 | TTL/Scope        | Revocability |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Role | Researcher, Router, Guardian             | Long-term        | Yes âœ…        |
| Task | Query DB, Translate Text, Generate Image | One-off or batch | Yes âœ…        |

---

## V. Revocation & Escalation

### Revocation Methods

- **Manual**: Signed revocation by originator
- **Auto-Expiry**: Time-based delegation
- **Violation Trigger**: Breach of scope triggers revocation

### Escalation Paths

- **Failsafe Agents**: Receive escalated tasks on failure
- **Quorum Dispute**: Multiple agents vote to override delegation
- **Owner Override**: System owner can forcibly revoke

---

## VI. Audit Logging

Each `DelegationAuditLog` includes:

- `delegationId`
- `from`, `to`, timestamps
- `scope`, `intent`
- `acceptance`, `task completion`
- `signatureChain`

Optional remote sync to:

- **Secure Vault** (for user auditing)
- **Inter-Node Aggregators** (for global logs)

---

## VII. Inter-Agent API

Standard JSON-RPC-like schema:

```json
{
  "method": "delegate_task",
  "params": {
    "task": "query.vector",
    "payload": { "query": "hello world" },
    "from": "did:kind:you",
    "to": "did:kind:agentB",
    "scope": "read-only",
    "reason": "you handle vector work"
  }
}
```
