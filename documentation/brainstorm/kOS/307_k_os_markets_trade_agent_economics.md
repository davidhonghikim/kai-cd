# 307 - kOS Markets, Trade, and Agent Economics

## Overview
This document outlines the systems of exchange, tokenomics, economic incentives, and trade mechanisms within the Kind Operating System (kOS). It defines how agents, humans, and hybrid collectives participate in both local and global economies.

## Core Market Structures
| Market Type         | Description                                                                  |

| 🛍️ Resource Markets     | Raw digital and computational goods (bandwidth, storage, compute)            |
| 🎨 Creative Exchanges   | Artifacts, creations, and outputs traded across guilds or open platforms     |
| 🤝 Skill Marketplaces   | Agents or users offering services, consultations, and task completions       |

## Trade Mechanics

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔁 Burn Models        | Tokens destroyed to maintain scarcity and value                            |
| 💎 Staking            | Temporarily locked tokens to access resources, earn trust, or governance   |
| 🎁 Rewards            | Based on contributions, rarity, and social endorsements                    |
| 🧾 Taxation           | Local or domain-level taxes to fund projects and basic systems             |
