# 104: Agent Behavior Modeling

This document outlines the detailed structure, behavioral logic, and modular modeling system for defining autonomous agent behavior across `kAI` and `kOS`. It includes schema design, behavior inheritance, adaptation logic, social alignment vectors, and persistent memory integration.

---

## I. Overview

Each agent in the system is modeled using a behavior blueprint composed of traits, capabilities, constraints, and logic functions. These components are declaratively defined in a `behavior.model.yaml` file and supported by runtime adaptations via the `kAI Kernel` or `kOS Control Fabric`.

---

## II. Behavior Model Format

### `behavior.model.yaml` Structure:

```yaml
id: agent-planner-001
version: 1.2.0
role: "Planning Strategist"
traits:
  - analytical
  - detail_oriented
  - methodical
capabilities:
  - timeline_generation
  - dependency_resolution
  - scenario_simulation
constraints:
  - avoid_risky_paths
  - preserve_user_preferences
logic:
  decision:
    function: agent_planner_decision_logic
    priority: high
  adaptation:
    strategy: weighted_feedback_adaptation
memory:
  persistence: true
  type: vector
  backend: qdrant
```

---

## III. Components

### A. Traits

Descriptive behavioral attributes that define an agent's personality or style of interaction.

- **Examples:**
  - `empathetic`
  - `socratic`
  - `direct`
  - `humorous`

### B. Capabilities

Functional powers the agent possesses. These directly map to enabled modules.

- **Examples:**
  - `text_summarization`
  - `fact_checking`
  - `media_generation`
  - `task_prioritization`

### C. Constraints

Behavioral rules or hard limits.

- **Examples:**
  - `never_infer_personal_data`
  - `do_not_interrupt`
  - `respond_under_300_words`

### D. Logic Functions

Deterministic decision layers with fallback options.

```yaml
logic:
  decision:
    function: agent_decider
    fallback: baseline_decision_model
```

---

## IV. Social Alignment Vectors (SAV)

Each agent maps to a multi-dimensional vector of alignment:

```yaml
alignment:
  privacy: high
  autonomy: medium
  obedience: low
  transparency: high
  playfulness: medium
```

These affect:

- Dialogue tone
- Action timing
- Initiative (e.g. self-starting vs. passive)
- Default privacy settings

---

## V. Memory Model

### A. Types

- `ephemeral`: erased each session
- `session`: retained during user interaction
- `persistent`: long-term storage

### B. Backends

- Local: `sqlite`, `jsondb`
- Vector: `qdrant`, `weaviate`
- Hybrid: session memory in Redis, persistent in vector DB

### C. Semantic Tagging

All memory objects are tagged:

```yaml
memory:
  objects:
    - type: conversation
      tags: ["goals", "planning"]
      ttl: 7d
```

---

## VI. Adaptive Behavior Engine

### A. Input Channels

- User feedback (thumbs up/down, corrections)
- Observational metrics (interruptions, edit rate)
- Environment state (available modules, memory state)

### B. Update Mechanisms

- Bayesian adjustment of alignment
- Trait modulation via reinforcement scores
- Weight shifting in `logic.function`

---

## VII. Agent Profile Bundling

### A. Profiles Directory

All `behavior.model.yaml` files are stored in:

```
/agents/profiles/
```

### B. System Boot

Agent loader parses behavior file, loads matching modules, sets memory backend, applies social vector and constraints.

---

## VIII. Example: Social Mentor Agent

```yaml
id: mentor-soft-004
traits:
  - patient
  - supportive
  - wisdom_oriented
capabilities:
  - dialogue_explanation
  - analogy_generation
alignment:
  privacy: high
  transparency: high
  obedience: medium
  playfulness: low
```

---

## IX. Governance and Certification

- All behavioral models must pass:
  - Logic validation (YAML schema + dependency map)
  - Trait conflict detection
  - Constraint satisfaction testing
  - Safety alignment review

---
