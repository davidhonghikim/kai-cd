# 142: Privacy Enforcement and Consent Management Layer

This document defines the technical structure, rules, and protocols for enforcing user privacy and dynamic consent throughout the kAI and kOS systems. This layer ensures all data usage, access, sharing, and transformation is governed by user-controlled policies, agent declarations, and zero-trust defaults.

---

## I. Core Principles

- **User First** – All data belongs to the user. Consent must be explicitly granted, and revocable.
- **No Implicit Access** – Agents and services must explicitly declare intent and request permission.
- **Just-in-Time Consent (JITC)** – Dynamic prompts for permission with granular scopes.
- **Auditability** – Every access is logged and explainable.
- **Federated Privacy** – Local, device-level control with optional synchronization across a user’s devices.

---

## II. Core Components

### 1. PrivacyController (Core Module)

- Centralized policy engine for the current node/user.
- Stores all consent rules, flags, overrides, and revocations.
- Manages JITC UI prompts and enforcement logic.

### 2. ConsentSchema

```yaml
- resource: profile.email
  scope: read
  granted_to: agent:kalendarAgent
  expires: 2025-12-01
  conditions:
    - context: "only if adding calendar event"
    - notify: true
```

### 3. AgentManifest Privacy Block

```json
"privacy": {
  "access": [
    "contacts.read",
    "calendar.write",
    "filesystem.local:read:/notes"
  ],
  "purpose": "Manage calendar scheduling with AI help",
  "fallback": "Continue without contact sync"
}
```

### 4. Consent UI Module

- Pops up when an undeclared or expired access request is made.
- Displays:
  - Who is requesting
  - What data
  - Why it’s needed
  - Options: Allow once / Allow always / Deny / Customize

---

## III. Enforcement Hooks

### 1. Runtime Interception

- Any data access call must go through the `PrivacyController.intercept()` gate.
- Returns data, a proxy, or error based on consent logic.

### 2. Data Ingress

- Incoming data from users is tagged with sensitivity, origin, and processing constraints.
- Tags propagate through the data pipeline.

### 3. Agent Runtime Policies

- Agents operate in privacy-sandboxed VMs.
- Policy modules inject hooks for storage, API, and memory access.

---

## IV. Storage and Synchronization

### 1. Local Vaulted Consent Ledger

- Stores encrypted user decisions, consents, overrides.
- Versioned. Can export to backup or synchronize.

### 2. Sync Options

- **Offline Only (Default)**: All decisions local to device.
- **Federated Sync (Optional)**: Sync to trusted user devices only.
- **Encrypted Cloud Vault (Opt-in)**: Hosted by user or trusted service.

---

## V. Protocols

### 1. Kind Link Protocol (KLP) – Consent Envelope

```json
{
  "type": "consent_record",
  "origin": "agent:kAI",
  "resource": "notes.read",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-21T16:04Z",
  "status": "granted",
  "expires": "2025-09-01"
}
```

### 2. Consent Revocation Event

```json
{
  "type": "revoke",
  "target": "agent:memoryAgent",
  "scope": "session_logs",
  "reason": "user request via dashboard",
  "effective": "immediate"
}
```

---

## VI. User Configuration

### YAML Settings Example

```yaml
privacy:
  default_policy: deny_all
  consent_expiry_days: 90
  require_audit_log: true
  prompt_style: minimal
  sync_mode: offline_only
```

---

## VII. Governance & Audit

- **Admin Audit Console** – Views access logs, consent diffs, and enforcement status
- **User Transparency Hub** – Shows agents, their access, purposes, and revocation options
- **KLP Audit Export** – Push access logs into user-controlled archival systems or chains

---

## VIII. Future Additions

- Purpose Inference Models (PIMs) to guess likely data use and alert mismatch
- Time-locked consents and scheduled audits
- Group-level policies (household, team, org)
