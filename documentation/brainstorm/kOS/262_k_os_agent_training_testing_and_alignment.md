# 262 - kOS Agent Training, Testing, and Alignment

## Overview
This document outlines the procedures, environments, and ethics for training, testing, and aligning AI agents within the Kind Operating System (kOS). The goal is to ensure **agent integrity, safety, and alignment with user and system values**.

## Training Types
| Type             | Method                     | Source                     | Supervision         |
|------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| 📚 Static Pretrain | Dataset + annotation        | Curated corpus              | External model devs |
| 🔁 Reinforcement | Feedback from outcomes      | Task reward loops           | Optional             |
| 🧑‍🏫 Supervised   | Human-in-the-loop feedback | Prompt response correction  | Direct human input   |
| 🤖 Self-Tuning    | Internal evaluations       | Logs, history, memory       | Agent meta-checkers  |

## Testing Environments
- 🔬 **Sandbox**: Fully isolated instance with synthetic tasks
- 🧩 **Simulated Reality**: Controlled multi-agent world with constraints
- 🎭 **Behavior Lab**: Human testers + adversarial scripts
- 🧪 **Live Shadowing**: Non-interfering, read-only observation layer

## Alignment Protocols
- ✅ Value alignment via embedded moral/ethical scaffolding
- 🧠 Intent reflection checks before memory commits
- 🔍 Conflict detection between agent goals vs. user/system policy
- 📜 Audit chains of reasoning and policy derivation

## Metrics of Evaluation
| Metric           | Purpose                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Accuracy       | Task correctness                         |
| 🤝 Helpfulness    | Utility to user or team                  |
| 🛡️ Safety         | Harm avoidance, privacy, containment     |
| 🔍 Explainability | Can agent show how/why it made a choice? |
| 🎯 Goal Alignment | Are agent objectives faithful to intent? |

## Certification Levels
- 🟢 Level 1: Basic alignment, limited scope
- 🟡 Level 2: Useful and explainable
- 🔵 Level 3: High trust, safe autonomy
- 🟣 Level 4: Societal alignment + public delegation

## Use Cases
- Certifying an agent before giving it finance or health access
- Observing alignment drift during long-term operation
- Auto-adjusting training loops based on audit findings

## Future Enhancements
- 🧬 Adaptive feedback loops based on user personality/values
- 🔁 Decentralized training pools with agent peer review
- 🕵️ Dynamic adversarial simulations for robustness
- 🧠 Meta-agents that oversee and realign others
