# 49: KLP Specification – Kind Link Protocol (Agent & Entity Interoperability)

This document provides a full specification of the Kind Link Protocol (KLP), a foundational interoperability standard for agent communication, permission negotiation, and decentralized coordination across the kAI/kOS ecosystem.

---

## I. Purpose

KLP enables autonomous agents, user applications, and external entities to:

- Discover each other
- Authenticate identities
- Negotiate capabilities and access
- Exchange structured, signed messages
- Link into shared multi-agent workflows
- Participate in distributed governance and state synchronization

## III. Identity Layer

### A. DID & Keys

- Every entity (agent, service, user) has a **Decentralized Identifier (DID)**
- Backed by X25519/Ed25519 keypairs (Curve25519)
- Identity doc stored locally, or anchored on-chain (optional)

```json
{
  "id": "did:kind:agent123",
  "publicKey": "edpk...",
  "type": "agent",
  "service": [
    { "type": "KLPService", "endpoint": "wss://..." }
  ]
}
```

---

## IV. Handshake Protocol (KLPHandshake)

1. **Hello** — Initiator sends DID + supported capabilities
2. **Challenge** — Receiver responds with encrypted nonce
3. **Verify** — Initiator signs and returns challenge response
4. **Accept** — Secure KLP session established

All messages are KLPEnvelope structures with metadata and signature:

```ts
interface KLPEnvelope {
  from: DID;
  to: DID;
  type: 'capability_request' | 'link' | 'state_update' | 'ping';
  timestamp: string;
  body: object;
  signature: string;
}
```

---

## V. Capability Negotiation

Agents and services request access to one another via signed capability requests:

```ts
interface KLPCapabilityRequest {
  requester: DID;
  requested: DID;
  capabilities: string[]; // e.g. ['read:memory', 'query:vector', 'delegate:workflow']
  reason: string;
  expiry?: string;
  signedBy: DID;
}
```

KLP provides a response format with acceptance, rejection, or partial grant.

---

## VI. Trust Link Graph

The trust network is maintained locally via a DAG of signed relationships:

- **Weighted trust links**
- **Expiry and decay policies**
- **Delegation path tracing**

Each node can export and import trust bundles for federated trust stitching.

---

## VII. State Sync & Event Replication

Entities in the KLP mesh can synchronize lightweight state using:

- `KLPStateUpdate` – push or pull key-value state updates
- `KLPDeltaMessage` – optional CRDT or diff-based merge
- Topic-based filtering, rate limits, and auth envelopes

---

## VIII. Registry & Discovery

Each kAI node maintains a **local registry** of known agents/services:

- Indexed by DID
- Tracks last-seen, trust rating, capabilities
- Configurable gossip protocol for neighborhood discovery

Global coordination can occur through:

- **Federated hubs** (e.g. `hub.kos.local`)
- **Blockchain-anchored directories** (future optionality)
- **QR code/URL out-of-band introductions**

---

## IX. Governance Hooks

KLP supports optional governance layers:

- Voting envelopes with signed ballots
- Off-chain coordination, on-chain anchoring (zk-rollup optional)
- Token-weighted, trust-weighted, or user-preference based quorum

---

## X. Security Design

- **End-to-End Encryption** for all envelopes
- **Nonce challenges** to prevent replay
- **Rotating key support** via updated DID docs
- **Capability scoping** and revocation
- **Envelope audit logs** stored in encrypted local history

---
