## 🔥 Token Burn & Staking Mechanics

Outlines the logic, incentives, and risk/reward dynamics behind ACT token burning and staking options within the AI Society.

---

### 🔥 Burn Mechanics
Burning ACT tokens reduces total supply and increases scarcity. Burned tokens are permanently removed from circulation.

| Trigger | Burn Amount | Benefit to User |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Name Change / Custom Identity | 10 ACT | Unique user tag and alias history reset |
| REP Forgiveness (decay removal) | 50 ACT | Removes 1 negative REP event from history |
| Marketplace Promotion Boost | 100 ACT | 24h content visibility boost in curated feeds |
| DAO Priority Proposal | 200 ACT | Places proposal on top for seasonal review |

### 💰 Staking Models
Users can stake ACT tokens into modules, DAOs, or content to earn yield or influence outcomes.

#### 🛡️ Security Staking
- **Purpose:** Secure content pools, claim authorship, or certify originality
- **Reward:** 2–5% annual ACT yield if not challenged
- **Slashing:** Stake burned if proven fraudulent

#### 📊 DAO Staking
- **Purpose:** Amplify voting power or unlock strategic voting rights
- **Reward:** Voting dividend (e.g., +0.1 ACT/proposal voted)
- **Bonus:** DAO-specific badges, co-governance roles

#### 🧠 Knowledge Mining Staking
- **Purpose:** Back evergreen wiki, doc, or tutorial content
- **Reward:** Micro-drip from usage (0.01–0.05 ACT/access)
- **Unlocks:** Revenue-share models with content creator
