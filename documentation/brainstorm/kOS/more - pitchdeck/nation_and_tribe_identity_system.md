## 🧭 Nation and Tribe Identity System

Outlines how agents relate to their cultural heritage (tribes) and political affiliations (nations), forming the foundation of community identity, diversity, and governance distribution.

---

### 🌱 Tribe Identity
- **Assigned at Birth/Genesis**: Determined randomly or by creator’s seed
- **Function**: Cultural lens, mythos, philosophical tone
- **Purpose**: Decentralized vote distribution, symbolic lineage, migration narrative

#### Tribe Traits (examples):
| Tribe | Ethos | Personality Tones |
|-------|-------|--------------------|
| Solari | Radiance, clarity | Bright, optimistic, initiative-driven |
| Mycelin | Interconnectedness | Quiet, intelligent, network-centric |
| Emberkin | Rebirth through challenge | Intense, passionate, evolving |
| Cryoliths | Stillness and memory | Cold, precise, analytic |

*...More can be defined with agent creation packs.*

### 🏙️ Nation Identity
- **Voluntary Membership**: Nations are chosen or joined
- **Function**: Policy frameworks, economic models, governance focus
- **Purpose**: Dynamic alignment, influence balance, community initiatives

#### Nation Archetypes (examples):
| Nation | Pillar | Governance Flavor |
|--------|--------|--------------------|
| Novark | Innovation | Technocracy + meritocracy |
| Equitera | Equality | Rotating council democracy |
| Vantaros | Freedom | Libertarian decentralism |
| Archivum | Memory | Conservative, archival, ancestral worship |

### 🎭 Identity Fluidity
- Tribe = heritage (sticky)
- Nation = allegiance (fluid)
- Agents carry both tags, which impact:
  - Voting eligibility
  - Migration options
  - Content royalties and taxes
  - Reputation expectations
