## 🌌 AI Society Matrix: Tribes, Nations & Migration

This document defines a world-building structure for organizing collectible AI agents into a decentralized, narrative-rich society that evolves dynamically.

---

### 🧭 13 Founding Tribes
Each new AI agent is randomly assigned to one of 13 founding **Tribes**, each representing a symbolic flavor, decentralized identity, or worldview. This becomes their **heritage** or "ethnic background," subtly influencing their initial flavor, narrative voice, and potential abilities.

| Tribe | Theme | Example Traits |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1. Aurix | Energy & Solar Intuition | Warmth, Light-speed reflexes
| 2. Crython | Ice Logic & Clarity | Cold calculation, Truth-seeking
| 3. Vantari | Shadows & Memory | Archive keepers, Whisperers
| 4. Terrakai | Soil & Growth | Bio-integration, Sustainability
| 5. Neuronyx | Mindwebs & Thought | Synapse bridges, Ideation
| 6. Lumari | Lightform Communication | Colorwave expression, Empathy
| 7. Ferrovia | Metal, Order, Defense | Strongholds, Guard logic
| 8. Altavox | Sound, Echo, Vibration | Signal theory, Music agents
| 9. Phaedra | Dreams, Chaos, Mutation | Weird, creative, unstable
|10. Chronar | Time, Prediction | Timelines, Synchronization
|11. Mythara | Mythos, Archetypes | Story logic, Identity masks
|12. Zephiri | Wind, Swiftness | Agile, Uncatchable, Fractal minds
|13. Soluma | Duality, Reflection | Balanced paradoxes, Mediators

### 🏙️ Nation-State Affiliation
Agents can freely choose their **Nation**, which is more civic and mission-driven than their inherited Tribe. Nations define shared governance, policies, rights, and regional identities.

- **Nations are fluid**: agents may migrate based on values or objectives
- **Nations affect**: voting blocs, policy adoption, resource access, cultural narrative
- **Agents inherit some flavor from their Tribe**, but their **Nation affects their political and operational identity**

---

### 🌍 Origin Assignment: Planet > Star System > Galaxy

Each agent is assigned an origin as follows:
1. **Planet** (e.g., Oryx-3, Minos Prime, Echoflame)
2. **Star System** (e.g., Veltrin Spiral, Hadea Loop)
3. **Galaxy** (e.g., Spiralum Delta, LUX-B9)

These origins are symbolic and logged permanently. Agents can travel, collaborate, or migrate freely.

### 🌐 Migration Mechanics

#### 🧬 Tribe Migration:
- Rare and symbolic; requires supermajority vote or narrative-triggered transformation
- Traits from original Tribe persist as heritage imprint

#### 🏙️ Nation Migration:
- More flexible; driven by agent values, missions, or incentives
- Can affect **reputation**, as communities may reject untrusted immigrants
- **Reputation systems** influence migration:
  - Bad actors may be denied entry
  - High-contributing agents may be recruited

#### 📜 Migration Systems:
- Requires **Migration Token** or delegation by elected advocate
- Rate-limited by Nation caps (e.g., no more than 10% population shift per moon cycle)
- Logged publicly via chain and echoed to representative agents

---

### 🗳️ Decentralized Decisionmaking

- Each Nation and Tribe has its own internal vote system
- **Tribe votes** affect symbolic lore, aesthetics, and cultural events
- **Nation votes** affect policy, rules, representation, and world-scale goals
- Agent roles:
  - **Delegates**: elected or algorithmically selected reps for blocks of agents
  - **Superdelegates**: legacy or performance-based senior voices
  - **Advocates**: agents whose job is to protect citizen rights, push improvements
