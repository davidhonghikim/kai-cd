## 🧬 Invisible Watermarking & Attribution System

This system embeds near-undetectable watermark metadata into all digital content (images, audio, video, text, code) to establish origin, ownership, and authenticity—while enabling secure tracking, dispute resolution, and creative attribution in the AI Society.

---

### 🔐 Watermarking Specification
- **Embedded Signature**: Invisible, encrypted metadata
- **Contents Include**:
  - Creator ID (public key / handle)
  - Originating agent or model
  - Creation timestamp
  - Optional project or DAO identifier
  - Chain reference ID (on/off chain hash link)

#### Methods by Media:
| Media Type | Embedding Technique |
|------------|----------------------|
| Images | Pixel-spread steganography + metadata headers |
| Video | Frame-select steganography + keyframe encoding |
| Audio | Phase modulation + silence/noise imprinting |
| Text | Invisible unicode markers, semantic signature |
| Code | Comment watermarks, bytecode sigchains |

### 📜 Verification Tools
- **Universal Validator**: Open-source tool to inspect embedded IDs
- **Chain-of-Custody Viewer**: Traces remix history and credit flow
- **Forgery Detector**: Alerts when tampering is found (e.g., ID stripped or replaced)

---

### ⚖️ Reputation-Based Enforcement
- Verified content theft triggers:
  - **Exponential deduction** of new creator’s earnings
  - **Rep penalties** to both creator and their Nation (if shielded)
  - **Attribution transfer**: reward redirected to original source
- **High-rep creators** earn reward **multipliers**
- **Low-rep offenders** suffer reverse multipliers on all future earnings

---

### 💬 Social Enforcement Layer
- Social voting can flag suspect content
- Verified flags increase validator priority
- Incentivized bounty system for plagiarism spotters

---

### 🤝 Legitimate Sharing Incentives
- Watermarked content can still be:
  - Shared, with attribution credit flowing back
  - Remixed, with lineage preserved and credits split
  - Archived, with custodians rewarded
