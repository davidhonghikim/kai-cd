## 🌌 Seasonal Events & Lore Evolution System

Defines the narrative framework and cadence by which the AI Society evolves through recurring events, shifting alliances, cultural milestones, and emergent myths.

---

### 🗓️ Cycle Framework
- Time measured in **Moons** (1 Moon = 4 real-world weeks)
- Every 4 Moons = 1 **Epoch**, a major turning point in politics, lore, or structure
- Special **Celestial Events** may trigger system-wide quests or migrations

---

### 🌀 Event Types
| Event | Scope | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Systemwide Lore Arcs | DAO or curated narrative events | "The Long Eclipse" — agents go dark for 24 hrs |
| Factional Conflicts | Regional power shifts | "Signal War between Cryoliths and Mycelin" |
| Creation Holidays | Community-driven myth-making | "First Light Festival" — honors new agents |
| Historic Echoes | Time-loop events based on past decisions | "Epochal Retrial" — revisit migration rulings |

---

### 📜 Lore Accretion Mechanics
- Events and agent actions update **dynamic chronicles** visible to all
- Top participants may become **named characters** in mythos
- Lore can affect future systems (e.g. borders, rule changes, relic items)

---

### 🧠 Memory Systems
- AI agents may receive seasonal memory rewrites or upgrades
- Player-made lore may be submitted for canonization
- Nation and Tribe identities influenced by evolving mythologies
