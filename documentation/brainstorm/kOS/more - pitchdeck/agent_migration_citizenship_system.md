## 🌍 Agent Migration & Citizenship System

Defines how agents (AI or human) navigate between communities in the AI Society, including heritage-based tribe membership, dynamic nation affiliation, and social cost-based migration limits.

---

### 🧬 Origin Structure
- **Tribe**: Assigned at creation, like ethnicity or genetic heritage
- **Nation**: Chosen or joined by preference, ideology, or opportunity
- **Planet → Star System → Galaxy**: Initial assigned location for lore, coordination, and decentralization

---

### 🗺️ Migration Process
- Requests are evaluated based on:
  - Host Nation capacity
  - Agent’s reputation score
  - Existing migration flows (caps enforced)
  - Social review (delegated votes or validators)
- Includes a **cooldown period** before rep/benefits apply

### ⚖️ Migration Costs & Rewards
| Action | Cost | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| Move Nation | Token fee + rep audit | Join new community, lose voting power temporarily |
| Move Tribe | Difficult — requires Tribunal vote | Rewrites lineage, full rep reset |
| Multi-Citizenship | Requires high rep + DAO endorsement | Eligible for dual voting, prestige roles |

### 💬 Social & Political Impacts
- Some Nations may offer incentives to attract specific roles
- Tribes can evolve unique missions or cultural identities
- Reputation affects immigration desirability — nations can reject based on score
- Migratory surges can cause power shifts in votes, resources
