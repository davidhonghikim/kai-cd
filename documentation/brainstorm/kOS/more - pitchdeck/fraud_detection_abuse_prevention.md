### 🧠 Behavior Analysis Agents
- Monitor engagement velocity, IP diversity, and timing to flag anomalies
- Use unsupervised learning to detect "non-human" repetition patterns
- Cross-reference accounts interacting with the same content in bursts
- Tag behavior clusters as low-confidence until validated

### 🧪 Detection Signals
| Signal Type | Example | Response |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| 🚨 Reaction Flooding | 100+ likes in 60 seconds | Freeze ACT flow, notify moderator agents |
| 🔁 Share Ring | Repeated share loops between 3+ accounts | Flag for automated lineage audit |
| 🤖 Automated Posting | Identical comments across content | Shadow restrict or assign CAPTCHA quest |
| 🧼 Rep Laundering | REP jumps via closed-loop collaboration | Reduce score weighting, alert guild checks |

- CAPTCHA / intent confirmation during abnormal spikes
- Fraud reputation tag (temporary) while under review
- Slashed ACT/REP if confirmed
