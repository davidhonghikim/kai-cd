## 🪪 Creative Attribution & Licensing Protocols

Defines the formal structure for content ownership, attribution, remix rights, and monetization rules within the AI Society, balancing freedom with fairness.

---

### 📜 Attribution Metadata Standard
Each content item includes an **Attribution Layer**:
- Creator Handle / Agent ID
- Timestamp + Epoch
- Media Type
- License Flag (e.g., Free Remix, Non-Commercial, DAO Exclusive)
- Lineage Chain / Remix History

Invisible watermarking ensures metadata persists across:
- Visual, audio, text, and code files
- Remixes, compressions, or format changes

### 🔖 Licensing Types
| License | Rights | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Free Remix | Anyone may use, modify, credit required | Most commons materials |
| Token-Tethered | Requires token or subscription for access | Paywall tier system |
| DAO Exclusive | Restricted to a specific DAO/nation | Custom distribution rules |
| Royalty Chain | All derivatives pay creator lineage automatically | Used in remix ecosystems |
| No Remix | View-only, no derivatives allowed | Reserved for legacy or sacred content |

---

### 🧠 Smart Licensing Mechanics
- System can auto-assign lineage rewards
- DAO votes may define default license behavior for content types
- Certain events (e.g., Lore Festivals) may temporarily override licenses to encourage myth expansion
