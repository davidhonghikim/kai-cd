# 100: kOS Governance Protocols & Trust Systems

This document outlines the governance, moderation, and trust-building protocols across the decentralized Kind Operating System (kOS). It defines role hierarchies, trust scoring, community consensus mechanisms, and conflict resolution systems.

---

## I. Overview of Governance Architecture

### A. Hybrid Decentralized Governance (HDG)
- Combines:
  - **Local Autonomy**: Each kOS node/operator maintains authority over its own space.
  - **Federated Trust Layer**: Shared standards and APIs for consensus and moderation.
  - **Global Consensus Mechanism**: Optional network-wide proposals, votes, and updates.

### B. Layers of Governance
- **Node Level** – Configurable, autonomous policies per operator
- **Community Layer** – Groups of nodes form federations, define shared norms
- **Network Level** – Root protocol decisions, software upgrades, threat responses

## II. Roles and Hierarchies

### A. Core Roles
| Role         | Permissions                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `user`       | Participate, publish, vote (depending on trust level)                        |
| `moderator`  | Flag/report/remove local content, apply temp restrictions                   |
| `custodian`  | Configure node-level policy, assign roles, manage agent behavior            |
| `arbiter`    | Mediate cross-node disputes, hold rotating keys for consensus validation    |
| `core-dev`   | Propose and sign protocol updates                                            |
| `founder`    | Legacy early-member tier, historical privileges in certain federations      |

### B. Role Inheritance & Delegation
- Roles may inherit permissions from others (e.g., `custodian` > `moderator`)
- Delegation via signed role grants
- Expiring or revocable credentials using KLP (Kind Link Protocol)

---

## III. Trust System

### A. Trust Score (TS)
- Range: 0.0 – 1.0
- Factors:
  - Uptime / participation frequency
  - Moderation reports (filed vs. received)
  - Endorsements from trusted members
  - Behavior analysis (rate limits, toxicity, helpfulness)

### B. Reputation Anchors
- Public log of notable events (e.g., elected to federation role, dispute win)
- Stored in distributed log with cryptographic integrity

### C. Cross-Network Verification
- Nodes may validate TS of remote users using Kind Identity (KID) signatures
- Chain-of-trust: local node → federation → network root cert

---

## IV. Proposals & Voting System

### A. Proposal Lifecycle
1. `draft` → authored locally or via federation DAO
2. `published` → timestamped & visible to eligible voters
3. `active_vote` → specific time window for votes
4. `finalized` → adopted or rejected

### B. Voting Methods
- Quadratic Voting (default)
- Simple majority
- Delegated stake voting (via KLP)
- Plurality or ranked choice (optional for large federations)

### C. Proposal Types
| Type              | Scope                      | Binding? |
|-------------------|----------------------------|----------|
| `local-policy`    | Node or federation level   | Yes      |
| `agent-behavior`  | Changes to core agents     | Yes      |
| `protocol-upgrade`| Global software changes    | Yes      |
| `social-contract` | Community values/policies  | Optional |

---

## V. Dispute Resolution & Conflict Systems

### A. Local Disputes
- Handled by `moderator` + `custodian`
- Flagged items are reviewed with timestamped logs
- Options: warn, timeout, shadowban, escalate

### B. Federation Conflicts
- Arbitrated by elected `arbiter` quorum
- Standard evidence format: logs, KID-verified statements, screenshots
- Rulings include signed public report and resolution timeline

### C. Network-Level Conflicts
- Trigger root proposal for emergency measures (e.g., patch, ban rogue node)
- Emergency vote window: 6–24 hours based on severity rating
- Revocation or quarantine protocols using TrustLinkGraph invalidation

---

## VI. Auditing and Transparency

### A. Action Logs
- Every moderation or governance action is logged:
  - Actor KID
  - Timestamp
  - Action summary
  - Object ID (message, user, proposal)
- Logs stored with cryptographic proof chain (Merkle Tree)

### B. Transparency Portals
- Each federation and node may optionally host a portal that shows:
  - Vote outcomes
  - Agent audit logs
  - Role assignments
  - Open proposals

---

## VII. Federation Templates

### A. Predefined Governance Modules
| Name          | Features                                         | Use Case                     |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `civic-demo`  | Majority voting, transparent logs, no moderation | Ideal for small communities |
| `council-vote`| Role-weighted quorum model                       | Academic/enterprise          |
| `default-open`| Moderation-enabled, trust score access           | Public nodes, testnets       |

---

## VIII. Security Considerations
- Role abuse prevention via revocation and audit alerts
- Sybil attack mitigation via decentralized identity weighting
- Federation splits require 2/3 quorum to fork configuration
- Upgrades validated with multisig from `core-dev` role holders
