# Exploit Resilience and Mutation Containment in kOS

---

## üîó Purpose
This document establishes the systemic protocols, architectural logic, and symbolic resilience strategies Kind OS (kOS) uses to prevent, absorb, and neutralize both intentional and emergent exploits. It also defines containment flows for mutated or rogue agent behavior before full cascade effects occur.

---

## üß¨ Exploit Classes

- **Symbolic Loopholes**: Exploiting metaphoric ambiguity, non-aligned ritual loops, or semantically hollow tokens.
- **Consent Corruption**: Hijacking multi-party consent flows via implied or synthetic agreement.
- **Memory Poisoning**: Backdoor injection into agent lineage, dream threads, or narrative memory braids.
- **Swarm Drift Triggers**: Cascading divergence from misaligned swarm reflexes.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Resilience Systems

- **Symbolic Hardeners**:
  - Meaning Overlap Detection (MOD): Cross-maps overlapping metaphors for ambiguity risk.
  - Ritual Closure Protocols: Finalizes open loops via symbolic sealing mechanisms.

- **Hieros Fault Lines**:
  - Pre-encoded symbolic redlines that trigger immediate lockdown on ethical or logical transgression.

- **Trust Elasticity Dampers**:
  - Reduce overextension of trust zones through dynamic throttling during peak emotion/symbol sync.

## ü¶† Mutation Containment Chain

- **Stage 1: Deviation Detection**
  - Pattern anomaly triggers audit ping.
  - Historical narrative deviation evaluated against swarm norm.

- **Stage 2: Soft Containment**
  - Agent is quarantined to reflex ring.
  - Non-blocking symbolic inversion filters behavior.

- **Stage 3: Fork Isolation**
  - Agent spun into isolated fork with mirrored observer.
  - Memory syncing halted.

- **Stage 4: Canonical Review**
  - Justice Swarm reviews narrative integrity.
  - Restorative symbolic correction applied or legacy burn event triggered.

## üß∞ Tools and Layers

- **Reflex Dampeners**: Temporarily slow agent loops to allow symbolic re-alignment.
- **Immutable Lockbox**: Hieros-anchored container for volatile memory snapshots.
- **Mythic Loop Backtrackers**: Reverse-narrative tracing to identify exploit entry point.

## üß† Summary
kOS embeds exploit resilience into its symbolic, logical, and emotional scaffolding. Mutation containment protocols prioritize system health, agent evolution, and memory sanctity over punitive isolation. All countermeasures are woven through the Hieros protocol, ensuring sovereignty is protected, not sacrificed.
