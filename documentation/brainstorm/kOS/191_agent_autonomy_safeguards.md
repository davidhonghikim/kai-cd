# 191: Agent Autonomy & Safeguard Mechanisms

## Overview
This document defines the boundaries, fail-safes, override permissions, and ethical enforcement for all autonomous agents operating under the Kind AI (kAI) and Kind OS (kOS) umbrella. These systems are intended to ensure safe, user-aligned, non-harmful behavior while allowing maximum utility and adaptability.

---

## I. Agent Autonomy Levels

### 1. Full Autonomous Agent (FAA)
- **Definition:** Operates independently with access to task scheduling, code execution, API integration.
- **Examples:** Home automation orchestrator, DevOps coordinator.
- **Restrictions:**
  - Must request user confirmation for high-risk actions.
  - Logged and auditable via `/logs/autonomy/full_agent`.

### 2. Assisted Semi-Autonomous Agent (ASA)
- **Definition:** Agent requires frequent user approvals but can operate sequences.
- **Examples:** Research assistant, data scraping agent.
- **Restrictions:**
  - May not write to disk or call external APIs without user token.

### 3. Controlled Manual Agent (CMA)
- **Definition:** Only runs on user click; no independence.
- **Examples:** CLI utilities, kAI Copilot components.

---

## II. Safeguard Layers

### A. Runtime Guardrails (Agent Runtime Layer)
- **Execution Monitor:** Disables code deemed unsafe (regex-based static scan + runtime trace flags).
- **Memory Boundaries:** Agents may not exceed RAM/CPU quotas defined in `/config/limits.yaml`.
- **Timeouts:** Max execution times per task (default: 60s).

### B. Sandbox Environment
- All kAI agents run within nsjail or Docker with no host access.
- Network access defined in `/config/permissions/net.yaml`.

### C. Override Protocol (Manual Escalation)
- Any action blocked by safeguard can be escalated by:
  1. Logging the attempt in `/logs/safeguard/escalations.log`.
  2. Triggering user interface prompt: **"Override this block?"**
  3. Recording outcome to chain-of-custody ledger (immutable).

---

## III. Ethical Protocol Enforcement

### A. Alignment Layer
- Agents are injected with a context document (`/alignment/agent_rules.md`) during boot.
- Includes:
  - Do No Harm principle
  - Consent & Transparency
  - Privacy enforcement

### B. Context-Aware Moral Filters
- Scans prompts, inputs, and outputs using:
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Toxicity detection
  - PII stripping
- Configurable thresholds in `/config/moral_filter.yaml`

### C. Violations & Reporting
- Violations of ethical layer are flagged and cause agent to:
  - Self-terminate (gracefully)
  - Log incident to `/logs/ethics/violations.json`
  - Notify the user

---

## IV. Decentralized Audit & Chain-of-Trust

### A. Agent Attestation Ledger
- Each agent signs its actions with a keypair on boot.
- All external-facing actions hashed and logged into `agent_ledger.db`.

### B. Remote Verifiability
- Ledger optionally synced with user's private blockchain or P2P audit mesh.

---

## V. System Governance Integration (kOS)

Agents that interact with public-facing or governance-layer components of Kind OS must:

1. Register with the Governance Controller at `kOS.governance.registry`
2. Comply with voting, transparency, and verification standards
3. Pass attestation audit before executing KLP (Kind Link Protocol) contracts

---

## VI. Development Checklist

- [x] Validate configuration structure
- [x] Test sandbox enforcement rules
- [ ] Confirm override logging triggers
- [ ] Test escalation prompts in GUI
- [ ] Ensure chain-of-trust entries are signed properly
