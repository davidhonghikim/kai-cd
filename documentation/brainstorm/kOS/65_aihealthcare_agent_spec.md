## I. Purpose & Goals

- Empower users to manage and monitor health independently
- Support for aging-in-place, chronic care, and disabilities
- AI-assisted triage, alerts, medication adherence
- Integrate with wearables and home medical equipment
- Provide evidence-based education and behavior nudging
- Ensure compliance with medical privacy standards (HIPAA/GDPR)

## III. System Capabilities

### A. Data Ingestion

- Wearables: Fitbit, Apple Watch, Garmin, etc.
- Medical Devices: glucometers, BP monitors, CPAP
- Manual Input: via UI or voice
- EHR/EMR Integration: via FHIR (read-only unless authorized)

### B. Core AI Skills

- **Symptom Triage**: LLM-based first-pass triage (not diagnostic)
- **Alert Management**: Thresholds + ML anomaly detection
- **Medication Support**: Reminders, interactions, refill alerts
- **Wellness Coaching**: Behavior nudges, sleep/activity advice

### C. Interfaces

- Secure Web App & Mobile Interface
- Optional CLI for Linux-based caregiver dashboards
- Notification system: Push/Email/SMS

### D. AI Stack

- Langchain agents w/ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Med-specific datasets via PubMed + UMLS embeddings
- Prompt templates tuned for conversational medical safety
- Access to structured data through vector and SQL retrieval

---

## IV. Data Privacy & Ethics

### A. Storage

- All PHI stored encrypted (AES-256)
- Stored locally unless explicit cloud backup enabled
- Configurable data expiration & deletion

### B. Transmission

- TLS 1.3 for all external data exchanges
- E2E encrypted chat with remote clinicians (Signal protocol)

### C. Access Control

- Per-feature access scope w/ per-user audit logs
- Role-based permissions for family, caregivers, clinicians

---

## V. Security Layers

- Full integration with kindAI Vault
- Device verification via signed DID handshake
- Anomaly detection for unauthorized access
- Self-destructable data caches (configurable TTL)

---

## VI. Future Expansions

| Feature                                | Version |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- |
| On-device Edge AI for wearables        | v1.2    |
| Custom GPTs for chronic condition mgmt | v1.3    |
| Auto-generated reports for clinics     | v1.4    |
| Federated learning for health models   | v1.6    |
| Emergency dispatch integration         | v2.0    |

---

## VII. Compliance & Validation

- Code validated against NIST 800-53 Low/Moderate baselines
- GDPR compliance certified via automated policy engine
- All patient-facing interfaces tested for WCAG 2.1 AA

---

## VIII. Related Agents

- `kindAI_Caretaker` (emotional and daily task assistant)
- `kAI_Memory` (medical timeline and pattern memory)
- `kOS_KLP` (secure multi-agent trust protocol)
- `kindVault` (secret and credential manager)

---

## IX. Agent Persona

**Name:** kindAI Med\
**Tone:** Compassionate, clear, never alarmist\
**Speech Style:** Plain language, medically literate, evidence-referenced\
**Rules:** Will not give a diagnosis, will always refer to sources, never overrides clinician instructions

---

## X. Sample Use Cases

- "Check my mom's blood sugar trends and alert me to spikes."
- "Remind me to take my meds and alert me if I forget."
- "Talk to my doctor and send them a weekly health report."
- "Let me know if my heart rate is abnormally high tonight."
- "Is it safe to take ibuprofen with my current medications?"
