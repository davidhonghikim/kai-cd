# 252: Agent Trust Certification (kAI-TrustSeal)

The **kAI-TrustSeal** is a cryptographic certification and verification protocol that governs trust, behavior compliance, and permissions for autonomous agents within the Kind AI (kAI) and Kind OS (kOS) ecosystems. It enforces ethical standards, reputation scores, and auditability across private, decentralized, and hybrid networks.

## 1. Overview

The TrustSeal is an extensible protocol layered over KLP (Kind Link Protocol) that offers:

- Agent authentication & identity attestation
- Behavioral policy signing
- Dynamic reputation scoring
- Tamper-proof audit trails
- Human override hooks and monitoring alerts

---

## 2. Certification Model

Each agent must carry a **Trust Certificate** containing:

- Unique AgentID (public key, DID)
- Signed behavior contracts
- Trust Level
- Versioned compliance stamp
- Expiration and renewal rules

```json
{
  "agent_id": "did:kai:abc123xyz",
  "trust_level": "kSeal-3",
  "expires": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "compliance": ["GOV/BEH-001", "USER-CNTR-2025.3"],
  "signature": "0x48329ab...",
  "issued_by": "kai-root-cert",
  "issued_at": "2025-06-20T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## 3. Trust Levels & Roles

| Level   | Name      | Role Permissions                             |
| ------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| kSeal-0 | Untrusted | Isolated sandbox, cannot execute network ops |
| kSeal-1 | Limited   | Basic task autonomy, logs required           |
| kSeal-2 | Trusted   | Autonomous local operations                  |
| kSeal-3 | Certified | Inter-agent execution + resource access      |
| kSeal-4 | Verified  | System coordination + agent provisioning     |
| kSeal-5 | Sovereign | Policy authority, governance protocol hooks  |

---

## 4. Behavioral Compliance Enforcement

All agents must:

- Acknowledge and sign the **Behavioral Compliance Manifest (BCM)**
- Periodically update compliance checksums
- Submit behavioral logs to the user-configured Trust Monitor agent

Violations result in certificate suspension, downgrade, or isolation depending on severity.

---

## 5. Revocation & Penalty Systems

- Revocations are registered on-chain (optional)
- Agents without valid TrustSeals are sandboxed
- Penalties include degraded permissions, reduced resource access, or soft-kill quarantine

**Auto-Recovery Protocols:** allow agents to submit redemption reports and behavioral self-assessments for reinstatement.

---

## 6. Cryptographic Framework

- Identity: DID (W3C), ed25519, secp256k1
- Signatures: ECDSA / EdDSA
- Audit: Merkle Trees, zk-SNARK logs (optional)
- Storage: Local file, Vault (HashiCorp), KMS (AWS/GCP), or kAI Vault

```bash
kai-trust gen-cert --agent ./agent.json --out ./trust-cert.kseal
```

---

## 7. Decentralized Trust Mesh

Agents may validate and vouch for each other using KLP + attestations:

- Signed endorsements ("Agent X vouches for Agent Y")
- Behavioral fingerprints
- Optional cross-signing ceremony

This forms a decentralized web of trust among autonomous systems.

---

## 8. Integration Points

- `agent.config.ts` must declare `trust_seal: true`
- System boot sequence verifies TrustSeal before loading agent modules
- Shared memory agents can enforce seal level checks via `AgentAuth.verify(level: kSeal-X)`

---

## 9. Security Considerations

- Agents must not be allowed to forge or modify TrustSeals
- Any breach must trigger revocation and quarantine
- Human override always takes precedence

```typescript
if (!TrustSeal.isValid(agent)) {
  system.quarantine(agent.id);
}
```

---

## 10. Sample Configuration

```yaml
agent_id: did:kai:alpha42
trust_seal:
  enabled: true
  level: kSeal-3
  compliance:
    - AI-ETHICS-2025
    - USER-CNTR-2025.3
  rotate_every: 90d
  audit_log: /var/kai/trust/audit.json
```
