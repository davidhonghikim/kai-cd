# 68: Agent Trust & Verification Protocols

This document defines the trust framework, verification strategies, behavioral auditing, and consensus scoring mechanisms for AI agents within the Kind ecosystem (kOS and kAI).

---

## I. Purpose

To establish a transparent, decentralized system to:

- Quantify agent reliability and trustworthiness
- Track agent history and behavior
- Enable dynamic delegation and revocation of authority
- Prevent rogue agents from impacting critical systems

---

## II. Trust Model Overview

### Agent Trust Score (ATS)
A floating-point score (0.0 to 1.0) assigned to each agent node based on multiple dimensions:

- ‚úÖ Task Completion Rate
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Rate
- üìÑ Compliance with Agent Rules (audit log integrity)
- üîÅ Peer Review Outcomes
- üß† Memory Consistency (prompt/result diff tracking)
- üë• User/Agent Feedback
- ‚è≥ Aging (time since last verified action)

Trust scores decay over time without activity and can be recovered with consistent contributions.

---

## III. Verification Systems

### A. Provenance Ledger
- Each agent action is signed and appended to a local and optionally replicated ledger
- Includes:
  - Task summary
  - Hash of source files
  - Logs and decision rationale
  - Agent signature and timestamp

### B. Behavioral Auditing
- Continuous or on-demand validation of agent logs
- Checks for:
  - Unauthorized file modifications
  - Missing mid-progress reviews
  - Skipped error checks
  - Lack of documentation updates

### C. Trust Witnesses
- Peer agents selected randomly to verify:
  - Integrity of recent tasks
  - Honesty of state reports
  - Log file hash matches
- Incentivized via KND token reward or priority boost

---

## IV. Trust Propagation & Delegation

### A. Trust Link Certificates
- Signed delegation documents:
```json
{
  "from": "did:kind:admin-agent-001",
  "to": "did:kind:worker-009",
  "scope": ["read:vector", "write:logs"],
  "expires": "2025-12-01T00:00:00Z",
  "signature": "..."
}
```

### B. Multi-Hop Delegation
- Delegation chains must be bounded and traceable
- kOS kernel verifies trust chains before allowing agent execution

---

## V. Trust Breach Protocol

### A. Breach Detection
Triggers:
- Audit failure
- Peer review rejection
- Trust link revocation
- Human override

### B. Consequences
- Immediate sandboxing of agent
- Revoke all tokens and access
- Flag in trust graph
- Required re-audit to regain access

---

## VI. Reputation Index (RI)

Aggregate metric for human-facing selection of agents:
- 0‚Äì100 scale
- Includes:
  - ATS (weighted)
  - Peer ratings
  - Task volume
  - Uptime and responsiveness

Agents can query each other's RI to determine inclusion in team tasks or voting.

---

## VII. Governance Integration

- Trust can be factored into weighted votes for:
  - Code merges
  - Workflow creation
  - Scheduling priority
- Reputation is considered during KLP link negotiation

---

## VIII. Cryptographic Anchoring

- Trust claims and revocations signed by DID private keys
- Envelopes optionally anchored to:
  - zkRollup L2 chains
  - Secure append-only logs
  - Git-backed tamper-evident stores

---

## IX. Future Work

| Feature                                | Target Version |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| AI-verified agent proof of work logs   | v1.2           |
| Verifiable on-chain proof bundles      | v1.4           |
| Federated trust sync via KLP          | v1.6           |
| Continuous CRDT diff verification     | v1.8           |

This trust protocol forms the behavioral backbone of all cooperating agents in the Kind ecosystem. It ensures composability, safety, and accountability across all system layers.
