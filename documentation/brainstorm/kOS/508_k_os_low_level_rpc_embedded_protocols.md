# kOS Low-Level RPC & Embedded Communication Protocols

## Overview
This document outlines the foundational Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanisms and embedded communication protocols used by kOS agents, containers, and distributed modules. These low-level systems provide robust, extensible, and lightweight messaging interfaces suitable for edge-to-core, agent-to-agent, and sandboxed module communications.

---

## Core Goals
- Establish consistent, minimal-overhead communication between all kOS components
- Support synchronous and asynchronous message patterns
- Enable embedded systems and low-power agents to participate in RPC-based workflows
- Ensure tamper-resistance, verifiability, and graceful degradation

---

## 1. RPC Transport Layer
### üîå Supported Transports
- **Loopback (Agent Internal)**: Shared memory + async bus
- **IPC**: Unix sockets, Named pipes
- **Network**: gRPC over HTTP/2, QUIC, ZeroMQ, custom swarmmesh
- **Fallback**: HTTP/1.1 JSON-RPC or CBOR for constrained devices

### üì¶ Payload Encoding
- Protobuf (primary)
- MsgPack (compact alt)
- CBOR (IoT/low-memory)
- Optional: Plain JSON (for debugging or legacy)

---

## 2. Invocation Patterns
### üß† Direct Invocation
- Traditional call-response
- Used for internal agent processes and local device interfaces

### üßµ Fibered Messaging
- Lightweight coroutine-based request chaining
- Interruptible, checkpointable
- Enables multi-step action flows

### üì° Asynchronous Broadcast
- Event pub-sub via agent swarm
- Ideal for state signaling, context diffusion, alerts

### üõ∞Ô∏è Cross-Network Invocation
- Secure tunnel initiation via edge trust proxy
- Supports NAT traversal, encrypted relays

---

## 3. Embedded Protocol Extensions
### üß¨ Microprotocol Capsules
- Small embedded protocol bundles used within WASM or container runtime
- Each capsule declares:
  - Interface definition
  - Auth strategy (e.g. nonce, HMAC, challenge-response)
  - Expected return types & fallback codes

### üï≥Ô∏è Sandboxed Interface Pipes
- Virtualized pipes for isolated module comms
- Memory ringbuffers, time-sliced
- Access rules encoded via policy manifest

---

## 4. Security Features
- **All packets signed** with ephemeral agent keys
- **Replay detection** through timestamped nonces
- **Capsule-level ACLs** for microprotocols
- **Channel health monitor** for latency and corruption metrics

---

## 5. Use Cases
- Edge agent transmits sensor data via QUIC to mesh node
- WASM-embedded service calls RPC capsule to query swarm ledger
- Isolated module signals recovery via async pubsub to orchestrator

---

## Future Additions
- Real-time multiplexed RPC for swarm orchestration layer
- Mesh-aware rate control based on bandwidth consensus
- Agent-to-agent secure gossip API
