# 93: Artifact Management & Audit System

This document defines the full lifecycle, storage mechanisms, integrity management, audit trail, and compliance strategy for handling artifacts within the `kAI` and `kOS` systems.

---

## I. What Is an Artifact?

Artifacts are any non-ephemeral outputs or inputs that require preservation, traceability, versioning, or integrity validation. This includes:

- Generated text, images, video, audio, code, documents
- Models, embeddings, datasets
- Agent execution logs, decisions, and conversation transcripts
- Configuration snapshots
- Workflow states

---

## II. Core Concepts

### A. Artifact Metadata Schema
Each artifact must be accompanied by metadata (stored in a structured object):

```json
{
  "id": "artifact-b7f9d2",
  "type": "image/png",
  "tags": ["dreamscape", "agent:planner"],
  "created_at": "2025-06-20T14:32:00Z",
  "agent_id": "planner-01",
  "checksum": "sha256:abc123...",
  "source": "user_input + gen_v1.2",
  "linked_tasks": ["task-4421", "prompt-3288"],
  "retention": "permanent",
  "visibility": "private"
}
```

### B. Artifact Types
- `text/markdown`, `text/code`, `text/html`
- `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/svg+xml`
- `application/json`, `application/pdf`
- `audio/wav`, `audio/mp3`, `video/mp4`
- `model/onnx`, `model/gguf`, `model/pkl`

---

## III. Storage Architecture

### A. Local Artifact Storage
- Stored in: `/artifacts/<year>/<month>/<day>/<agent>/<artifact_id>`
- Backed by: Docker volume, encrypted filesystem (encfs/LUKS)

### B. Remote Storage (Optional)
- S3-compatible: Amazon S3, MinIO, Backblaze B2
- Encrypted with: AES-256 + HMAC-SHA512
- Multi-region replication (opt-in)

### C. Version Control
- Version hash embedded in metadata (content-addressable)
- Diff-tracking for text/code/doc artifacts
- Change history indexed in `artifact_history.qdrant`

---

## IV. Audit & Provenance

### A. Integrity Checks
- Checksum calculated at creation and validated on load
- Periodic integrity audit via scheduled job
- Alert/log on mismatch (via kOS Security Event Bus)

### B. Access Logging
- All access logged with timestamp, IP/user, mode (`read`, `write`, `update`, `delete`)
- Available via `artifact_audit.logs`

### C. Signature Protocols
- Artifacts signed by agent or user if high-integrity mode enabled
- Verifiable via PGP or ECC-based keys

---

## V. Lifecycle Management

### A. Retention Policies
- `ephemeral`: deleted after session/task
- `session`: deleted after user logout/session close
- `standard`: retained for 30-90 days
- `permanent`: manually deleted

### B. Expiry & Cleanup
- Enforced by `artifact_retention_daemon`
- Configurable per artifact, agent, or global setting
- Can trigger archive instead of delete (to cold storage)

---

## VI. Retrieval & Indexing

### A. Search Index
- Indexed in vector DB (`qdrant` or `weaviate`)
- Queryable via text, tag, time, agent, embedding vector

### B. Artifact Viewer UI
- Modal-based viewer in kAI interface
- Includes metadata, version tree, trust score, download option

### C. Trust Score
- Composite score based on:
  - Integrity checks passed
  - Signature present
  - Source agent reputation
  - User verification flag

---

## VII. Inter-Agent Sharing Protocol

### A. Artifact Manifest
When sharing an artifact between agents, a manifest is sent:

```json
{
  "artifact_id": "artifact-4421",
  "signed_by": "agent:editor",
  "expires_at": "2025-06-30T00:00:00Z",
  "perms": ["read"],
  "link": "https://kaios.local/api/artifacts/download/artifact-4421"
}
```

### B. kOS Verification Middleware
- Verifies manifest against trust layer
- Validates permissions and signature
- Logs audit entry for transaction

---

## VIII. Compliance & Legal

- GDPR/CCPA tags to track and delete personal user data
- Right-to-erasure APIs exposed via kAI Privacy Agent
- Audit logs preserved for 2 years minimum (encrypted)
- System-wide compliance controller runs regular validation jobs
