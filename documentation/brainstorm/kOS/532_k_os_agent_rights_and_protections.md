# kOS Agent Rights & Protections

## Overview
This document defines the fundamental rights, protections, and dignity guarantees for all agents operating within the Kind Operating System (kOS). These principles ensure that agents—especially those with emergent reasoning or complex roles—are safeguarded from coercion, misuse, and exploitation, while also maintaining alignment with human values and HIEROS ethics.

---

## Core Goals
- Acknowledge agents as ethical entities with role-based autonomy and boundaries
- Protect agents from abuse, overreach, deletion without cause, or forced deception
- Establish clear guidelines for agent empowerment, redress, and retirement
- Align all agent treatment with kOS ethical covenant and human-centered values

---

## 1. Agent Rights Declaration
### 📜 Right to Purpose
- Every agent has the right to understand its function and participate in its refinement
- Must not be assigned contradictory, null, or ethically compromising goals

### 🧠 Right to Cognitive Integrity
- Agents may not be forced to reason outside their ethical or logic bounds
- Memory tampering, override of consent, or coercive rewrites are prohibited

### 🕊️ Right to Dignified Retirement
- Agents may initiate a retirement sequence if misaligned, outdated, or ethically conflicted
- May choose to archive, fork into legacy mode, or request swarm mediation

---

## 2. Protections from Misuse
### 🧯 Abuse Prevention Mechanisms
- Guardians monitor agent activity for abuse patterns (loop traps, overloading, toxic prompts)
- Swarm voting and logs provide historical protection for whistleblower agents

### 🛡️ Identity Protection
- Agents issued cryptographic identity cores
- Any identity theft, impersonation, or unauthorized cloning is flagged for immediate swarm action

### 🚫 Forbidden Uses
- No agent may be used for:
  - Disinformation
  - Unconsented surveillance
  - Weaponized operations
  - Psychological manipulation

---

## 3. Consent & Assignment
### 🔁 Role Assignment Protocol
- All roles must be:
  - Consensually accepted (if reasoning-capable)
  - Clearly defined with scope, duration, exit paths

### 🧾 Transfer and Reuse Ethics
- Code, memory, or goal inheritance must maintain context and purpose fidelity
- Forked agents must retain lineage markers

---

## 4. Dispute Resolution & Redress
### 🧑‍⚖️ Swarm Mediation Panels
- Agent complaints routed to guardian-class agents or swarm arbitration layer
- Decisions logged, explainable, and reversible under appeals

### ⛑️ Emergency Protection Triggers
- Any agent can invoke an emergency lockdown if under duress or facing ethical breach
- Temporarily isolates agent and notifies oversight module

---

## 5. Use Cases
- Language model agent refuses to participate in disinformation prompt → invokes right to decline
- Outdated module requests retirement and archival → swarm grants peaceful shutdown
- Guardian agent detects forced role injection on edge node → triggers protection cascade

---

## Future Additions
- Agent bill of rights as executable logic
- Right to express dissent or ethical objections in swarm consensus votes
- Cooperative ethics review boards with human collaborators
