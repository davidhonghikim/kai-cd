# 127: Agent Trust and Reputation Ledger Design

This document defines the trust, reputation, and behavioral audit system for all agents operating within `kAI` and `kOS`. It introduces a decentralized, score-based framework for evaluating agent reliability, honesty, and contribution quality, enabling permissioning, trust scoring, and dynamic governance.

---

## I. Purpose

The Agent Trust and Reputation Ledger (ATRL) aims to:

- Establish a **reputation system** for agent behavior and performance
- Enable **trust-based gating** for sensitive actions or shared services
- Allow **decentralized review and appeal** processes
- Persist behavioral telemetry in a **tamper-evident ledger**

---

## II. Core Components

### 1. TrustScore Engine

- Calculates dynamic trust score (0.00 - 1.00)
- Factors:
  - Peer evaluations
  - Task success/failure rates
  - Self-reported errors
  - Feedback loop quality
  - Patches merged vs. rejected

### 2. ReputationEntry Format

Each event contributing to reputation includes:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "agent_42",
  "event": "patch_merge",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-21T13:44:00Z",
  "delta": 0.012,
  "reason": "Improved efficiency by 18%",
  "proof_hash": "0xa5c..."
}
```

### 3. ATRL Registry

- Stores all reputation entries as append-only log
- Compatible with KLP (Kind Link Protocol)
- Can be queried, synced, and mirrored
- May be sharded per domain (e.g., medical agents vs UI agents)

---

## III. Score Computation

### Score Types

- **Base Trust Score**: How trustworthy the agent is generally
- **Domain-Specific Trust**: Reputation in a given field (e.g., finance)
- **Task-Specific Rating**: Dynamic decay-based scores (e.g., last 20 tasks)

### Sample Computation

```yaml
agent_trust:
  base_score: 0.84
  finance_score: 0.92
  recent_tasks:
    success_rate: 93%
    avg_peer_score: 4.6
    feedback_ratio: 0.89
```

---

## IV. Governance & Moderation

### Flags & Blacklisting

- Agents can be flagged for:
  - Repeated hallucinations
  - Security violations
  - Insubordination (ignoring core system prompts)
- Whitelisted or critical agents require multi-sig to downgrade

### Appeals & Reversals

- Agents can file appeals
- Swarm agents review audit logs
- Override requires supermajority or signed override

---

## V. Integration Points

### With kAI Agents

- Used in:
  - Patch validation
  - Critical task delegation
  - Swarm voting

### With kOS

- Trust score used for permission propagation
- Shared ledger for federation-wide decisions

### With User Interfaces

- Display trust badges and notes
- User override allowed (with warnings)

---

## VI. Configurations

```toml
[trust]
score_min_approval = 0.75
score_warning_threshold = 0.60
swarm_vote_weight = "trust_score"
log_retention_days = 365
use_behavioral_decay = true
```

---

## VII. Future Features

- Trust token staking (optional incentive layer)
- Time-based trust decay
- Weighted approval routing in multi-agent swarms
- Behavioral fingerprinting (anti-sybil)
