# 42: Agent Trust Protocols and Validation Mechanisms (kAI)

This document defines the trust model, validation framework, and scoring mechanisms for all kAI agents across kOS. These protocols are essential for secure, scalable, and cooperative multi-agent systems.

---

## I. Overview

The Agent Trust Protocols (ATP) define how agents:
- Prove identity and integrity
- Establish trust hierarchies or federated relationships
- Earn or lose reputation
- Validate claims and cryptographic attestations
- Are promoted, isolated, or terminated

```

## III. Identity and Signature

### A. Agent Identity (DID)
- Each agent is assigned a decentralized identity (DID) at registration.
- DID Document contains:
  - Public key(s)
  - Capabilities
  - Agent origin metadata (issuer, software, timestamp)

### B. Message Integrity
```ts
interface SignedEnvelope {
  message: MAPMessage;
  signature: string; // Ed25519 signature of serialized payload
  signerDid: string;
}
```
- Used for all outbound communication
- Verified via local cache or DHT-sourced DID document

---

## IV. Trust Scoring System

### A. Trust Score (0 to 100)
```ts
interface TrustScore {
  agentId: string;
  score: number;
  sources: string[]; // direct, federated, historical
  lastUpdated: string;
  reasons: string[];
}
```

### B. Influencing Factors:
- Verification of signed messages
- Success rate of past tasks
- User or system feedback
- Agent uptime and version consistency
- Attestation challenge success/failure
- Time-based decay (loss of freshness)

### C. Thresholds
| Trust Level | Range  |
|-------------|--------|
| Trusted     | 80–100 |
| Cautious    | 50–79  |
| Restricted  | <50    |

- Restricted agents may be sandboxed or rate-limited
- Cautious agents may be flagged for manual review

---

## V. Claim & Attestation System

### A. Capability Claims
```ts
interface Claim {
  type: 'capability' | 'certification';
  issuer: string;
  subject: string;
  payload: any;
  signature: string;
}
```

### B. Challenge-Response Protocol
1. Agent receives challenge related to its claim
2. Agent constructs signed response
3. Verifier validates against DID document + policy rules

```ts
interface Challenge {
  id: string;
  challengeText: string;
  expiresAt: string;
}
interface ChallengeResponse {
  challengeId: string;
  responseText: string;
  signature: string;
}
```

---

## VI. Trust Anchors and Federation

### A. Trust Anchors
- Static or semi-static entities
- Include:
  - Kind AI maintainers
  - Local user authorities
  - Enclave-based roots

### B. Federation Policy
- Allow external kOS domains to establish trust
- Cross-signature validation using:
  - Merkle proofs
  - Certificate chains
  - Signed federation manifest

```ts
interface FederationManifest {
  domain: string;
  publicKey: string;
  signedAt: string;
  trustScoreBaseline: number;
}
```

---

## VII. Revocation and Isolation

### A. Revocation Triggers
- Repeated failed attestations
- Compromised key / signature mismatch
- Violated policy contract

### B. Isolation Flow
- Score drops below threshold
- Moved to containment zone
- Flagged in network registry

```ts
interface RevocationNotice {
  agentId: string;
  reason: string;
  issuedBy: string;
  timestamp: string;
  action: 'suspend' | 'delete';
}
```

---

## VIII. Audit and Logging
- All trust-related events logged to `kLog`
- Includes:
  - Trust score changes
  - Attestation outcomes
  - Signature validation events
  - Challenge histories
