## Reputation Dynamics
- 🪞 Contextual Reputation: Scores vary by community, task, or time period
- 🔁 Feedback Loops: Peer validation and appeals systems
- 🧠 Memory-Aware Judgement: Pattern recognition of intent, growth, or malice
- 🛡️ Protection Against Brigading: Throttle mass downvotes or smear attempts

## Trust-Driven Interaction
- 🔐 Trust-Gated Access: Some resources unlocked only with positive social signals
- 💬 Verified Context Agents: Fact-check, translate, or buffer based on history
- 🏛️ Social DAOs: Self-governing collectives who manage norms, bans, and mediation
- 🧬 Adaptive Norm Scaffolds: Customizable social protocols for each community or app

## Safeguards and Ethics
- ⚖️ Appealable Actions: Clear pathways for contesting bans, scores, or accusations
- 🌈 Diversity and Inclusion Matrices: Actively monitor for social clustering or exclusion
- 🧯 Emergency Shunning Locks: Temporarily isolate malicious agents across systems
- 🧪 Experimental Social Zones: Pilot new norms, incentives, and governance methods
