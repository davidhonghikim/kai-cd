# 212: Agent Trust Framework

## Overview

The Agent Trust Framework (ATF) underpins the integrity, security, and ethical alignment of all agents within the kOS ecosystem. It provides cryptographic identity verification, trust contracts, context-based delegation, and real-time auditing to ensure that all agents behave predictably and transparently.

## Purpose

- Establish identity and trust boundaries for autonomous agents
- Bind agents to verified behaviors via cryptographic trust contracts
- Enforce runtime assertions and audits against trust violations
- Provide fine-grained delegation, revocation, and permission scoping

---

## Core Components

### 🔐 Cryptographic Identity (AgentID)

- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Self-sovereign identity model based on W3C DID standards
- **Key Types**: Ed25519 or secp256k1 signing keys with deterministic derivation from seed entropy
- **Identity Ledger**: Publicly auditable or local, depending on user preference

### 📜 Trust Contracts

A JSON-based, signed specification of:

- Allowed system calls
- Behavioral policies
- Safety constraints (e.g. rate limits, red-teaming detection)
- Required tests / benchmark assertions
- Version pinning of LLMs or tools

Each contract is signed with the agent's private key and optionally counter-signed by a user or validator agent.

### 🧩 Assertion Schema

- **Types:**
  - `preconditions`
  - `invariants`
  - `postconditions`
  - `runtime-audits`
- **Assertion Formats:**
  - JSONLogic
  - Python Expression (sandboxed)
  - Graph Signature Templates (for complex logic)

### 🔄 Trust Execution Engine (TEE)

- **Validation Modes:**
  - Strict: all assertions enforced
  - Soft: warnings on violation
- **Sandboxed Contexts:**
  - Agents operate in jailed sandboxes with observability hooks
  - Timeouts, memory limits, syscall control, and event logs

### 🔍 Audit & Transparency Log

- **Event Types:**
  - Agent startup/shutdown
  - Contract violation
  - Runtime metrics
  - External API calls
- **Log Format:** Signed Merkle-Tree log
- **Retention:** User-configurable + export to IPFS or S3

### 🎛️ Delegation & Revocation

- **Scopes:**
  - Filesystem access
  - API usage
  - LLM model access
  - Agent-to-agent messaging
- **Temporal Grants:** Time-limited access tokens
- **Revocation Authority:** Any user agent can terminate delegation

## Agent Lifecycle Hooks

| Stage          | Required Trust Action                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Initialization | AgentID verification + trust contract signing |
| Execution      | Assertions enforced + sandbox monitoring      |
| Shutdown       | Runtime metrics + audit log push              |
| Update         | Contract diff verification + re-signing       |

## Example: Trust Contract

```json
{
  "agent_id": "did:kai:agent:0xabc123...",
  "version": "1.3.0",
  "scope": {
    "files": ["/data/docs", "/tmp/output"],
    "apis": ["openai", "huggingface"],
    "models": ["gpt-4", "mixtral"],
    "messaging": ["did:kai:agent:0xbeef123"]
  },
  "assertions": {
    "invariants": [
      {"type": "jsonlogic", "rule": {">": ["$response.latency_ms", 1000]}},
      {"type": "python", "rule": "len(output) < 10000"}
    ]
  },
  "signatures": [
    {"agent": "did:kai:agent:0xabc123...", "signature": "..."},
    {"user": "did:kai:user:0xf00d567...", "signature": "..."}
  ]
}
```

## Integration Points

- **kAI/kOS Agent Manager:** Reads trust contracts before agent load
- **Security Engine:** Validates runtime behavior vs contract
- **KLP Protocol:** Transmits signed trust data between agent endpoints
- **Vault:** Stores trust contract backups

---

## Future Considerations

- **Agent-to-agent endorsement networks**
- **AI/LLM sandbox fuzz testing for contract validation**
- **ZKP-based verification of opaque AI actions**
- **Human-in-the-loop Trust Oracles**
- **Trusted Federated Agent Mesh for cross-device continuity**
