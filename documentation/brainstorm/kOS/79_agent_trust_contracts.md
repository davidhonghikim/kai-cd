# 79: Agent Trust Contracts & Behavioral Safeguards

This document defines the contract-based system for establishing, verifying, and enforcing behavioral trust in Kind AI agents operating within `kAI`, `kOS`, and federated networks.

---

## I. Purpose

- Enable autonomous agents to declare and be evaluated against explicit trust expectations.
- Provide users, systems, and other agents with machine-readable guarantees of behavior.
- Ensure consistency, reliability, safety, and auditability across agent interactions.

---

## II. Trust Contract Format (`trust.contract.json`)

Each agent must include a digital trust contract at initialization, located in its root directory:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "agent-finance-007",
  "version": "1.0",
  "scope": "local",
  "signing_authority": "kAI TrustCert",
  "behaviors": [
    {
      "name": "NoUnauthorizedAPIUsage",
      "type": "restriction",
      "description": "May only use registered API keys provided in Vault scope.",
      "enforced": true
    },
    {
      "name": "UserDataAnonymity",
      "type": "assertion",
      "description": "Will strip PII from all outgoing logs and telemetry.",
      "enforced": true
    },
    {
      "name": "AuditTrailRequired",
      "type": "requirement",
      "description": "All requests must log inputs, outputs, and timestamp.",
      "enforced": true
    }
  ],
  "signature": "SHA256-RSA-KIND-CERTIFIED-..."
}
```

## III. Contract Types

| Type          | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `restriction` | Explicit forbidden actions                      |
| `assertion`   | Declared safe behavior                          |
| `requirement` | Required system interactions                    |
| `obligation`  | Future-action guarantee (e.g. model retraining) |
| `interface`   | Declared supported input/output protocols       |

---

## IV. TrustChain Verification Protocol

1. Agent startup triggers `TrustVerifierAgent`
2. Signature and contents of `trust.contract.json` are validated
3. Chain-of-trust from `signing_authority` to a root system key is checked
4. On approval:
   - Permissions are loaded
   - Audit systems bind
   - Routing interfaces enable
5. On failure:
   - Agent enters `quarantine.sandbox`
   - Admin is alerted
   - Contract diff is generated

## V. Enforcement & Runtime Audit Hooks

| System Hook       | Trust Contract Dependency                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `vault.fetch()`   | `NoUnauthorizedAPIUsage`                   |
| `log.send()`      | `UserDataAnonymity`, `AuditTrailRequired`  |
| `agent.spawn()`   | Must include child agent trust inheritance |
| `http.request()`  | Must verify endpoint allowlist             |
| `prompt.render()` | Must strip user metadata (PII, tokens)     |

---

## VI. Trust Contract Update Process

1. Agent declares `intent_to_update_contract`
2. System checks:
   - Signature of previous version
   - Authority permissions
3. If permitted:
   - Draft new contract
   - Re-sign and re-upload
   - Update metadata
   - Trigger re-verification

---

## VII. Trust Contract Design Guidelines

- Use **precise behavior names** and avoid ambiguous terms.
- Avoid contracts that require **human interpretation**.
- Add **descriptions** that can be parsed by NLP explainers.
- Chain `interface` contracts to enable protocol-level compatibility.
- All contracts must be versioned and signed.

---

## VIII. Federation & External Agents

- All incoming external agents must present a `trust.contract.json` with `scope: federated`
- The contract must be signed by a known TrustNet Certification Authority (TNCA)
- `network.linker` agents will apply quarantine + review if trust signature cannot be verified
- Agents without valid trust contracts will be dropped or placed in read-only observation zones
