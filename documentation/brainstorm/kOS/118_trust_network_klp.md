# 118: kOS Trust Network & KindLink Protocol (klp) Blueprint

This document defines the architecture, implementation, and operational protocols of the Trust Network Layer used in the `kOS` ecosystem. It introduces the `KindLink Protocol` (klp), the foundation of secure, interoperable, and reputation-aware communication between agents, users, devices, and services.

---

## I. Overview

The `KindLink Protocol (klp)` enables decentralized trust propagation, secure identity assertion, and rich metadata exchange across all nodes in the `kOS` mesh.

**Objectives:**

- Enable interoperable identity and metadata verification.
- Track and update trust levels across agent clusters.
- Federate trust decisions across disconnected subnetworks.
- Enable personal, organizational, and consensus-based governance models.

---

## II. Core Concepts

### A. TrustLinkGraph

- Directed graph where nodes represent unique identity URNs.
- Edges carry weighted trust assertions and purpose tags (e.g., `code_signer`, `data_validator`, `ai_guardian`).
- Nodes include agents, humans, devices, and organizational identities.

### B. Trust Level Semantics

- Trust levels range from `-3 (hostile)` to `+3 (fully trusted)`.
- Edge metadata includes:
  - `source`: identity creating the trust link
  - `confidence`: 0.0–1.0
  - `expiry`: optional TTL or decay rate
  - `tags`: contextual tags (e.g., `peer`, `validator`, `authority`)

### C. Identity URNs

- URN schema: `urn:klp:{namespace}:{type}:{hash}`
- Types: `agent`, `human`, `device`, `service`, `org`, `doc`, `sig`
- Hashes are derived from public keys, biometric anchors, or DID documents.

## III. Protocol Stack

### A. Transport Layer

- **Primary:** Reticulum, LoRaMesh, Tor Hidden Service
- **Fallback:** WebSocket / HTTP2 / gRPC
- Payloads signed with Ed25519

### B. Message Types

- `trust_link_create`
- `trust_link_update`
- `identity_challenge`
- `signed_metadata`
- `trust_level_request`
- `revocation_notice`

### C. Message Format (example)

```json
{
  "type": "trust_link_create",
  "source": "urn:klp:kindai:agent:5f6a...",
  "target": "urn:klp:openmesh:human:99aa...",
  "trust_level": 2,
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "tags": ["reviewer", "validator"],
  "signature": "base64-ed25519sig...",
  "timestamp": 1723344883
}
```

## IV. Protocol Operations

### A. Bootstrapping

- Seed nodes provide signed `trust_root` documents
- Agents verify at least 3 independent trust anchors (multi-path validation)

### B. Trust Sync

- Delta-synchronization of trust graphs via Merkle tree diffing
- Redundant broadcast with rate limiting
- Clients filter by trust policies (e.g., only show trusted level >= 1)

### C. Challenge-Response Verification

- Identity or behavior attestation via signed JSON-LD challenge
- Supports external key stores (YubiKey, TPM, Secure Enclave)

### D. Revocation & Decay

- Time-based decay of trust scores unless reinforced
- Explicit revocation notices cryptographically signed and broadcast

### E. Federation

- Federated subnets cross-sign their top-level trust anchors
- Nodes can request merged views using `trust_level_request`

---

## V. Implementation Stack

### A. Core Libraries

- `libklp-core` (Rust, Python)
- `klp-js` (for browser-based kAI instances)

### B. Data Storage

- Local Merkle-tree cache
- Syncs to Qdrant or Chroma for vectorized node queries

### C. Developer Tools

- `klp-cli`: manage identity keys, create links, simulate decay
- `trustviz`: graph rendering and explorer interface
- Integration with `kAI` credential vaults and `kOS` swarm agents

---

## VI. Use Cases

### A. Device Trust in Offline Mesh

- Sensor node signs biometric + geolocation report
- Sends trust assertion to aggregator node

### B. Human-AI Trust Scenarios

- User `A` marks assistant `B` as `trusted:2`
- All downstream modules inherit elevated access

### C. Organizational Governance

- Org anchor identity delegates permission to `doc_signer` agents
- Sub-delegations require quorum validation (>3 out of 5 anchors)

### D. API Verification Gateway

- Public-facing API only accepts requests from URNs trusted >=1
- Dynamic ACL rebuilt via klp policy engine

---

## VII. Future Work

- zk-SNARK integration for anonymous trust assertions
- Cross-chain trust portability using ERC-780 identity standard
- Voiceprint-backed trust challenges
- Integration with kOS Audit Chain
