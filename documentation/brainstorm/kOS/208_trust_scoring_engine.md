# 208: Trust Scoring Engine – Behavior-Based Trust and Reputation Framework

## Overview

The Trust Scoring Engine (TSE) is a core subsystem of kOS that continuously evaluates the integrity, reliability, and behavior of agents, services, and users participating in the ecosystem. It functions as both a real-time risk monitor and a long-term reputation ledger.

This document outlines:

- The technical implementation of TSE
- Data inputs and observation models
- The scoring algorithms
- Trust-based access control mechanisms
- Integration points with other subsystems (kAI, klp, security engine, agent kernel)

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- Detect anomalies and bad actors
- Adjust agent privileges dynamically
- Provide a reputation-based incentive model
- Feed into the Token Authority (see `207_Agent_Token_System.md`)

## ⚙️ Engine Architecture

    A[Observables] --> B[Trust Processor]
    B --> C[Score Normalizer]

    D --> E[APIs: Agent Kernel, Token Authority, Security Engine]
    B --> F[Flag System]
    F --> E
```

### Key Components

- **Observables:**
  - Event logs
  - API request patterns
  - File access records
  - Communication behavior (frequency, latency, precision)
  - Evaluation feedback from users or other agents
- **Trust Processor:**
  - Converts raw inputs into weighted events
- **Score Normalizer:**
  - Ensures consistent scoring ranges between 0.0–1.0
- **Trust Ledger:**
  - Long-term storage with time-weighted decay
- **Flag System:**
  - Real-time detection and notification of trust boundary violations

---

## 📥 Inputs

### 1. **Behavioral Events**

- CRUD operations
- Kernel call frequency
- Loop anomalies (e.g., retry storms)
- Plugin/API misuse

### 2. **Human Feedback**

- ✅ / ❌ user actions
- Post-task evaluations (1–5 stars)

### 3. **Peer Evaluation**

- Agent feedback
- Token staking votes (see `207_Agent_Token_System.md`)

### 4. **System Signals**

- Execution time
- Memory/cpu usage
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Failed decrypts or token misuse

---

## 🧮 Scoring Algorithm

```python
# Pseudo-code
trust_score = sigmoid(
  w_behavior * behavior_score +
  w_human_feedback * feedback_score +
  w_peer * peer_score +
  w_system * system_health
)

# Sample Weights
w_behavior = 0.4
w_human_feedback = 0.3
w_peer = 0.2
w_system = 0.1
```

- Uses a **sigmoid** activation to normalize scores
- Scores decay over time unless reinforced
- Thresholds:
  - < 0.2 → **Blocked**
  - 0.2–0.5 → **Restricted Mode**
  - 0.5–0.75 → **Monitored**
  -
    > 0.75 → **Trusted**

---

## 📚 Trust Ledger

- Powered by PostgreSQL with Redis for recent scores
- Indexed by `agent_id`, `user_id`, and `service_id`
- Contains full historical score logs
- Includes reason hashes and event references for auditability
- Exposed via FastAPI endpoints with RBAC control

---

## 🔐 Enforcement & Integration

### Access Control

- Tied into the Agent Kernel
- Services must query `GET /trust/{agent_id}` before executing privileged ops

### Token Throttling

- Lower scores → fewer token allocations from Token Authority

### Real-time Feedback Loop

- Frontend UI can show trust badges
- Users can override low-score gating with explicit warnings

## 🔄 Configuration

```yaml
trust_engine:
  scoring:
    decay_days: 30
    sigmoid_k: 1.5
    weight_behavior: 0.4
    weight_human: 0.3
    weight_peer: 0.2

## 🔍 Future Enhancements

- Machine learning anomaly detection
- Blockchain ledger integration (zero-knowledge scoring proofs)
- Community score validators

---

## ✅ Status

- Scoring algorithm implemented
- Ledger schema complete
- Needs production integration with kAI and Security Engine
- UI Trust Badge component in progress
