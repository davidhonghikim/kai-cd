# 256 - kOS Permissions and Access Control

## Overview
This document outlines the structure, strategy, and enforcement mechanisms behind **Permissions and Access Control** in the kOS (Kind Operating System). It ensures secure, modular, and fine-grained control of actions, resources, and data across the AI ecosystem.

## Goals
- 🔐 Ensure **secure default states** for all components.
- 🧩 Enable **delegated authority** across agents and modules.
- ⚙️ Provide **flexible control levels**: User > Agent > Sub-agent > App > Kernel.
- 🧠 Align access rights with memory boundaries and trust levels.

## Permission Tiers
1. **Public**: Anyone can access (e.g. public files, open prompts).
2. **Private**: Limited to agent or specific user.
3. **Trusted Circle**: Defined group of agents/users.
4. **Delegated**: Temporary or scoped authority granted to a proxy agent.
5. **Root/System**: Requires explicit user override or elevated access.

## Identity & Verification
- All access requests are **signed** and **timestamped**.
- **User IDs**, **agent fingerprints**, and **session keys** must validate.
- Optional integration with biometric or hardware tokens for key operations.

## Permission Matrix
| Action                     | Public | Private | Trusted Circle | Delegated | Root |
|----------------------------|--------|---------|----------------|-----------|------|
| Read Memory Logs          | ❌     | ✅      | ✅             | ✅        | ✅   |
| Modify Kernel Config      | ❌     | ❌      | ❌             | ❌        | ✅   |
| Deploy New Agent          | ❌     | ✅      | ✅             | ✅        | ✅   |
| Interact with User Vault  | ❌     | ❌      | ❌             | ✅        | ✅   |
| Access External API       | ✅     | ✅      | ✅             | ✅        | ✅   |

## Delegation Logic
Delegation tokens include:
- Scope (actions permitted)
- Expiration (timestamp or revocation logic)
- Issuer and holder identity
- Signed checksum to prevent spoofing

## Access Enforcement
- Each request is passed through a **policy engine**.
- Denials are **logged**, alerts may be triggered.
- Optional: agent rating/REP affected by violations or misuse attempts.

## Use Cases
- Allowing a mobile agent to sync user calendar with limited access.
- Granting a support agent one-time permission to debug another agent’s logs.
- Root-only configuration changes requiring user override or keypress.

## Future Considerations
- 🔄 Dynamic context-based permissions (location, time, task).
- 🪪 Reputation-based access scaling.
- 🧪 Integration with zk-proofs for anonymous delegation.
- 🌐 Cross-node decentralized access federation.
