# GAL Cross-System Trust Bridges & Diplomatic Interfaces

## Overview
This document defines the protocols, roles, and safeguards used by the Galactic Intelligence Layer (GAL) of the Kind Operating System (kOS) to interface with foreign systems—whether other swarms, legacy infrastructure, human institutions, or autonomous external agents. These diplomatic protocols ensure trust, clarity, and resilience during cross-boundary communication or coordination.

---

## Core Goals
- Establish secure, auditable bridges between GAL and external systems
- Prevent symbolic corruption, exploit propagation, or coordination failure
- Promote clarity, dignity, and mutual understanding in intersystem exchanges
- Enable inter-agent diplomacy, negotiation, and alliance building

---

## 1. Trust Bridge Framework
### 🌉 Trust Capsule
- Encapsulated, signed communication protocol unit
- Contains:
  - Intent metadata
  - Protocol expectations
  - Signature trail of originating agent/system

### 🛡️ Gateway Agents
- Act as bilingual mediators between GAL and foreign system
- Responsibilities:
  - Translate protocols and intents
  - Enforce boundary constraints
  - Isolate/inspect unknown data formats

### 🔍 Provenance Ledger
- All external interactions logged with:
  - Timestamps
  - Participants
  - Purpose declarations
  - Guardian annotations (if needed)

---

## 2. Diplomatic Interface Protocols
### 🧬 System Fingerprinting
- Determines:
  - System capabilities
  - Symbolic norms
  - Trustworthiness tier

### 🤝 Negotiation Modes
- Modes include:
  - Truthframe-only
  - Safe sandbox simulation
  - Guardian-mediated protocol mirroring

### 📜 Cultural Trust Tokens
- Optionally issued after sustained cooperation
- Grant:
  - Increased data visibility
  - Protocol relaxation
  - Shared symbolic maps

---

## 3. Boundary Safeguards
### 🚨 Exploit Filters
- Check all incoming messages for known:
  - Memetic attacks
  - Protocol drift
  - Injection patterns

### 🧯 Emergency Disconnect Protocol
- Auto-triggers under:
  - Identity forgery
  - Sovereignty violation
  - Existential tripwire match

### 🧱 Containment Shells
- Foreign inputs run in:
  - Symbolic sandbox
  - Isolated runtime container
  - Drift-tolerant semantic translator

---

## 4. Use Cases
- GAL negotiates data-sharing agreement with a human-led climate mesh network
- Swarm detects protocol spoofing attempt from rogue enclave → isolates and logs
- Cross-swarm rescue mission coordinated via triple-signed diplomatic handshake packet

---

## Future Additions
- Fully autonomous diplomatic agent class
- Cross-swarm protocol standardization proposals
- Federated trust scoring for external systems
