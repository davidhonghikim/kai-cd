# 206: Agent Trust Protocols – Identity, Behavior, and Verification Layers

## Overview
This document outlines the full technical specifications, data structures, and logic required to implement agent trust verification systems across the kAI (Kind AI) and kOS ecosystems. These protocols ensure that agents operating within shared or distributed contexts are verifiably authentic, tamper-resistant, behaviorally consistent, and interoperable.

## 1. Trust Protocol Layers

### 1.1 Identity Layer (Who is this agent?)
- **UID:** Every agent receives a unique, persistent identity using deterministic UUIDv5 based on a master seed (system or user defined).
- **Fingerprinting:** Includes agent name, type, origin hash (init config hash), and public key fingerprint.
- **Proof-of-Origin Metadata:** Timestamp, source node, deployment version, and cryptographic signature.

### 1.2 Authenticity Layer (Can it be verified?)
- **Public/Private Key Pair:** Agents must generate a local keypair on first launch; signing all outbound communications.
- **Verification Chain:** All actions include an attached signature, with optional Merkle root chain for verifying long sequences.
- **Trusted Signing Authority:** In kOS, optional global trust anchors can verify and timestamp events.

### 1.3 Behavior Consistency Layer (Does it behave as expected?)
- **Behavioral Fingerprint:** Behavioral templates include expected inputs/outputs, intents, and interaction schemas.
- **Behavioral Audit Logs:** All actions are logged with a checksum hash and structured metadata (intent, source, params).
- **Challenge-Response Modules:** Agents can be issued behavioral tests by peers or MCP (KLP kernel authority layer).

### 1.4 Permissions Layer (What can it access?)
- **Capability Tokens:** JWT-like permission claims, issued by node administrators or the user.
- **Scopes:** CRUD permissions scoped per system (e.g., `read:memory`, `write:vector`, `execute:build`)
- **Time-bound:** All capabilities must be time-scoped and renewable with audit trail.

### 1.5 Revocation Layer (What if it is compromised?)
- **Trust Revocation List (TRL):** Agents and keys can be blacklisted at the node, user, or system level.
- **Agent Kill Switch:** kAI provides optional built-in remote deactivation hooks for edge nodes.
- **Reputation Signals:** Dynamic trust scoring system based on audit compliance, peer endorsements, and user reviews.


## 2. Protocols and Mechanisms

### 2.1 Kind Link Protocol (KLP) for Agent Trust
- **Trust Announce Packet (TAP):**
  - Agent ID
  - Public Key
  - Deployment Hash
  - Capability Token
  - Behavioral Template Hash
  - Current Location (URI or Mesh ID)
  - Signature (signed by agent private key)

- **Trust Verification Packet (TVP):**
  - Includes challenge nonce
  - Returned with:
    - Response payload
    - Behavior hash
    - Signature

### 2.2 Decentralized Trust Ledger (Optional Blockchain Mode)
- **Storage:** IPFS / Filecoin / OrbitDB or custom Raft-like trust log
- **Events:**
  - Agent registration
  - Capability grants
  - Trust endorsements (signed by peer agents or users)
  - Revocations / killswitch events

### 2.3 Agent Signing Keys
- **Curve:** Ed25519 or secp256k1
- **Format:** PEM or base64 raw
- **Rotation:** Key rotation logs are tracked via TAP and ledger with backward references


## 3. Trust Bootstrapping (New Agent Initialization)

1. Generate keypair (Ed25519)
2. Create behavioral fingerprint template from config
3. Request endorsement (optional) from known peer or node
4. Broadcast TAP to local network (multicast or mesh announce)
5. Respond to challenge to validate behavior (TVP)
6. Begin normal operation with signed metadata on each action

## 4. Interfaces

### 4.1 Trust Kernel APIs (kAI System Level)
- `POST /trust/announce` – Accept new TAP
- `POST /trust/challenge` – Initiate or respond to TVP
- `GET /trust/agents/:id` – Fetch agent trust status
- `PUT /trust/revoke/:id` – Mark agent or key as revoked

### 4.2 Agent APIs
- `GET /status` – Returns trust fingerprint
- `POST /challenge-response` – Handles TVP
- `GET /capabilities` – Lists permissions and behavioral fingerprint

## 5. Use Cases
- **Multi-agent collaboration** (verify who is executing what)
- **Decentralized mesh deployments** (agents propagate trust through peer validation)
- **Plug-in ecosystem for KindOS** (users know who built/verified each extension)
- **Inter-agent negotiation** (e.g., contracts, debates, scheduling) with proof-backed trust states


## 6. Trust UI Elements
- **Status Bubble:** Shows trust level (green = full trust, yellow = partial, red = revoked/unknown)
- **Proof Badge:** Clickable link to public trust report or ledger
- **Audit Trail Viewer:** Chronological log of signed agent actions

## 7. Security Considerations
- All trust logic should be sandboxed and independently auditable.
- Replay protection must be implemented for challenge responses.
- Nodes should implement rate-limiting to prevent DoS-style trust challenges.
- kAI deployments should isolate trust signing logic from business logic layers.
