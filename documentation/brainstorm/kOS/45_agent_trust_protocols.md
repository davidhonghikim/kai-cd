# 45: Agent Trust Protocols and Verification (kAI / kOS)

This document outlines the full specification for agent trust management, authentication layers, behavioral analysis, and scoring systems for agents operating under Kind AI (kAI) and kindOS (kOS). This includes both runtime behavior analysis and lifecycle identity trust.

---

## I. Purpose

Establish a decentralized but verifiable trust framework for:
- Authenticating agent identity and capabilities
- Scoring agent reliability and behavior
- Enabling or restricting agent actions
- Supporting federated agent governance across instances of kAI/kOS

---

## II. Directory Structure

        └── federation.ts              # Federated trust sync via KLP (kindLink Protocol)
```

---

## III. Agent Identity

Every agent must have:
- A persistent UUID
- One or more signing keys (Ed25519 recommended)
- A signed capability manifest
- (Optional) Endorsements from other agents or users

### Example Identity Object
```ts
interface AgentIdentity {
  id: string;                     // UUID
  publicKey: string;             // Base64-encoded Ed25519 key
  signature: string;             // Manifest signature
  roles: string[];               // e.g., ['orchestrator', 'translator']
  endorsements: string[];        // Other agent signatures
  registeredAt: string;          // ISO8601 timestamp
}
```

---

## IV. Trust Score Calculation

Score ranges: `0.0` (untrusted) to `1.0` (fully trusted)

### Contributing Factors:
- ✅ Successful task completions
- ⚠️ Unexpected behavior (e.g., excessive retries, invalid output)
- ❌ Policy violations (e.g., accessing restricted data)
- ⏳ Uptime and availability
- 🧠 Correct use of memory and prompts
- 🤝 Endorsements from other agents

### Algorithm: Weighted EWMA
```ts
trustScore = 0.7 * priorScore + 0.3 * behaviorDelta
```

Policy gates:
- `> 0.8` — Full access
- `0.5–0.8` — Restricted/sandboxed
- `< 0.5` — Quarantined or rejected

---

## V. Trust Policy Manager

Allows human admins or root agents to:
- Set score thresholds for capability types
- Define quarantine/ban conditions
- Push manual overrides or resets
- Issue role-based trust assumptions

```ts
interface TrustPolicy {
  minimumScore: number;
  quarantineIf: (agentLog) => boolean;
  requireEndorsements?: number;
  roleOverrides: Record<string, number>;
}
```

---

## VI. Risk Classifier

Monitors agent behavior and classifies anomalies:
- Frequency of requests
- Invalid inputs/outputs
- Looping or runaway behavior
- Abuse of shared memory or storage

Uses rule-based heuristics + ML anomaly detection (future).

### Output
```ts
interface RiskAssessment {
  agentId: string;
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  reasons: string[];
  recommendedAction: 'none' | 'restrict' | 'terminate';
}
```

---

## VII. Audit Logs

All agent actions recorded to tamper-proof audit trail.
- Append-only log
- Includes timestamp, intent, result, and calling context
- Signed with agent key and stored in `kLog`

### Optional: `EvidenceVault`
Stores external evidence (e.g. failed outputs, screenshots, recordings) for:
- Human review
- Legal arbitration
- Autonomous appeal resolution (future)

---

## VIII. Federated Trust via KLP

Trust data is optionally shared across decentralized kAI/kOS instances:
- Sync trust scores
- Share banlists or allowlists
- Sign and verify agent credentials cross-domain

### Federation Protocol (KLP)
```ts
interface TrustSyncMessage {
  senderNode: string;
  timestamp: string;
  agentTrustRecords: AgentTrustRecord[];
  signature: string;   // Node-level signing key
}
```

Trust reputation becomes portable and can be cryptographically verified.

## IX. Use Cases

| Scenario | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| New agent connects | Require capability handshake, log identity
| Suspicious behavior | Auto-quarantine and notify orchestrator
| Trust sync across orgs | KLP sync of reputation and banlist
| User manual override | Admin dashboard triggers TrustPolicy update

---

## X. Future Features

| Feature | Target Version |
|---|---|
| Behavior-model anomaly ML | v1.1 |
| Agent signature revocation list | v1.2 |
| zkSNARK proofs of reputation | v2.0 |
| User-signed agent roles (DAO model) | v2.1 |
