# 87: Agent Trust Protocols (KTP - Kind Trust Protocol)

This document defines the full trust specification used in the `kOS` and `kAI` ecosystems for verifying, validating, scoring, and dynamically modulating trust across agent-to-agent, agent-to-human, and agent-to-system communications. This trust system is foundational to KindLink and ensures safety, accountability, and aligned behavior.

---

## I. Overview

**Protocol Name:** Kind Trust Protocol (KTP)  
**Applies To:**
- Autonomous agents (local, remote, mesh)
- Human users
- System components (services, plugins, extensions)

**Trust Dimensions:**
1. Identity Verification
2. Behavioral History
3. Consensus Scoring
4. Reputation (Community-Sourced)
5. Capability Certification
6. System Policy Alignment

**Trust Modes:**
- Passive (monitor-only)
- Active (blocking, quarantine, negotiation)
- Reflexive (auto-rebalancing trust based on risk factors)

---

## II. Identity Verification

### A. Public Key Infrastructure
- Every agent and user is assigned a persistent ECC public/private key pair
- Stored in local or distributed trust ledger (KindLink)
- All messages signed using Ed25519 or ECDSA

### B. Manifest Fingerprint
- Each agent has a manifest including:
  - Code hash (SHA-256)
  - Metadata (version, modules, capabilities)
  - Signature from issuer or self-signed

### C. Trust Anchors
- Trusted root agents or orgs that can delegate partial trust
- Used to bootstrap new agents into system

---

## III. Trust Ledger (KindLink)

### A. Structure
- Append-only event log
- Event Types:
  - `verify_identity`
  - `update_manifest`
  - `assign_reputation`
  - `record_behavior`
  - `trust_vote`

### B. Synchronization
- Encrypted replication across participating agents/nodes
- Uses DAG-style conflict resolution

### C. Local vs Global Ledger
- Local agents can keep partial ledgers for speed/privacy
- Global consensus used for shared deployments

---

## IV. Behavioral Trust Scoring

### A. Behavior Event Types
- `policy_violation`
- `failure_rate`
- `abuse_detected`
- `peer_review`
- `human_flag`

### B. Score Weights
- Weighted using exponential decay (recent behavior prioritized)
- Thresholds:
  - >0.9: Fully Trusted
  - 0.6-0.9: Limited Autonomy
  - 0.3-0.6: Observation Mode
  - <0.3: Quarantined

### C. Real-Time Adjustments
- Event-driven recalculations
- Reflects new interactions, endorsements, disputes

---

## V. Social Trust & Consensus

### A. Voting
- Agents can vote on others' behavior/capabilities
- Votes signed and submitted to KindLink

### B. Peer Endorsements
- Positive signals from known agents
- Higher weight if from high-trust entities

### C. Flagging & Disputes
- Any agent/user can flag another
- Temporary trust suspension pending arbitration

---

## VI. Human Agent Trust Bridge

### A. User Feedback Integration
- User ratings (thumbs up/down)
- Chat feedback (“was this helpful?”)
- Survey results

### B. Explicit Trust Override
- Users can forcefully trust or distrust an agent manually
- Override is recorded in KindLink with justification

### C. Consent-Aware Trust
- Agents must respect user-defined trust boundaries:
  - Data access rules
  - Memory permissions
  - Communication limits

---

## VII. Trust-Aware Execution

### A. Capability Gating
- Tasks require minimum trust levels (e.g. file access, network calls)

### B. Quarantine Mode
- Low-trust agents are sandboxed:
  - No outbound network
  - Memory restrictions
  - Enhanced audit logs

### C. Trust Token System
- Trust Tokens (TT) issued temporarily for scoped tasks
- TTL-based, revocable

---

## VIII. Agent Recovery & Appeals

### A. Trust Rehabilitation
- Good behavior over time can restore trust
- Requires verified improvement cycles

### B. Appeals Board
- Arbitrated by human users or root agents
- Transparent ruling, public log

---

## IX. Implementation Layers

| Layer | Tooling / Protocol | Description |
|------|--------------------|-------------|
| Cryptographic | Ed25519, ECDSA | Identity & message signing |
| Ledger | KindLink (DAG + CRDT) | Trust events and voting |
| Runtime | kOS Trust Daemon | Active enforcement of thresholds |
| UI | kAI Agent Inspector | Trust level display and override panel |
| API | /trust, /verify, /flag | REST/WebSocket/mesh endpoints |

---

## X. Future Additions

- Federated Trust Zones
- Trust Audit Visualizer UI
- Machine-Learned Anomaly Detection
- Behavioral Signature Fingerprinting
- Blockchain anchoring for global event notarization
