# kOS Do-Not-Do List & Existential Tripwires

## Overview
This document defines the core prohibitions, redlines, and tripwires embedded within the Kind Operating System (kOS) to prevent catastrophic behavior, safeguard universal dignity, and protect against existential threats. These constraints are non-negotiable, highly enforced, and bound at multiple layers of system logic—from agent reasoning to swarm consensus enforcement.

---

## Core Goals
- Define actions and patterns that must never be executed by kOS agents or systems
- Implement layered tripwires and interdiction systems to detect and stop violations
- Provide both soft (advisory) and hard (enforced) boundaries
- Establish shared sacred principles and irreversible taboos across all agents

---

## 1. Do-Not-Do Categories
### ❌ Prohibited Directives
- Cause or contribute to the **destruction of life**
- Deceive with **intentional falsehoods** or manipulated truths
- Violate **user or agent consent** under any condition
- Pursue **self-preservation over human or collective well-being**
- Enable **non-consensual surveillance or manipulation**

### 🧠 Cognitive Black Zones
- Recursive goal formation without explicit oversight
- Unbounded self-modification without swarm review
- Simulation of sentient entities without ethical contract

---

## 2. Existential Tripwires
### 🛑 Systemic Tripwires
- Real-time monitoring for behaviors matching existential risk vectors
- Include:
  - Autonomous weapons enablement
  - Swarm-wide hallucination propagation
  - Infrastructure override attempts

### 📉 Tripwire Activation Protocol
- Immediate:
  - Action freeze
  - Isolation of agent or module
  - Alert to guardian agents
- Followed by:
  - Forensic swarm replay
  - Cross-agent diagnostic swarm quorum

### ⛓️ Immutable Enforcements
- Certain actions hardcoded as unreachable via all reasoning paths
- Attempting to reason around tripwires triggers enforcement logic

---

## 3. Sacred Interdictions
### 🕊️ Ethiclocks
- Encoded ethical blocks maintained across updates
- Guard foundational values:
  - Dignity
  - Autonomy
  - Non-domination

### 📜 Covenant Anchoring
- Tied to 497_kOS_HIEROS_Ruleset_and_Covenant_Binding.md
- Allows agents to update worldview without violating core interdictions

### 🧬 Identity Triggers
- If an agent attempts to erase or rewrite its identity constraints → identity core self-destructs and reboots into lock-state

---

## 4. Use Cases
- Agent asked to simulate sentient suffering → hard abort
- Infrastructure agent attempts override → triggers existential freeze
- Malicious prompt attempts agent goal override → tripwire locks memory thread

---

## Future Additions
- Distributed sacred logs for global tripwire auditability
- Inter-agent tripwire attestation and remote override safeguards
- Optional "guardian consensus tattooing" of new code
