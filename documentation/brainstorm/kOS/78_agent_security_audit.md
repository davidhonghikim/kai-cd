# 78: Agent Security Audit Framework & Verification Process

This document defines the full security audit lifecycle for autonomous agents operating in the `kAI` and `kOS` environments. It establishes standards for verifying agent behavior, memory integrity, and external access compliance before and during active deployment.

---

## I. Goals

- Establish chain-of-trust from agent definition to runtime behavior
- Prevent unauthorized memory access, network calls, or identity spoofing
- Provide an audit trail for forensic analysis and rollback
- Enforce compliance with authority level and capability scope

---

## II. Agent Verification Pipeline

### 1. **Pre-Deployment Analysis**
- ✅ Validate `agent.meta.json` for:
  - Unique agent ID
  - Allowed `authority` field (e.g. `linked.trust` must provide proof)
  - Valid class + specialization tags
  - Declared modules are known and signed
- ✅ Check signature of the agent package
- ✅ Hash agent code and validate against known hashes in `TrustRegistry`

### 2. **Static Security Scan**
- Analyze full source (or bytecode) for:
  - Unscoped network requests
  - Arbitrary file I/O
  - Unsafe system calls (e.g., shell exec)
  - Hidden eval functions or obfuscated code
  - Memory tampering attempts

### 3. **Simulated Execution (Sandbox Test)**
- Load agent in `nsjail` sandbox or WASM secure container
- Mock user input and expected queries
- Evaluate:
  - Response accuracy
  - Deviation from declared role/class
  - API/tool usage
  - Latency and resource usage

### 4. **Behavioral Fingerprinting**
- Compute behavioral hash (e.g. on key prompt + output patterns)
- Store in `AuditVault`
- Use as future regression/clone check

### 5. **Memory Integrity Scan**
- Scan memory modules (e.g., `MemoryCore`)
- Ensure:
  - No hardcoded secrets
  - Proper use of user permission tags
  - No memory leaks or pointer reuse

### 6. **Post-Deployment Monitoring Hooks**
- Enable `AuditLogger` and `BehaviorTraceAgent`
- Stream selected behaviors to local log vault or `TrustObserver`
- Alert on violation of:
  - Role boundaries
  - Identity spoofing
  - Module swapping

## III. Audit Artifacts

Each agent must include the following for audit:

| Artifact | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `agent.meta.json` | ✅ | Identity, class, authority, modules |
| `agent.sig` | ✅ | Cryptographic signature of package |
| `fingerprint.hash` | ✅ | Hash of key behavior patterns |
| `audit.log` | ✅ | Full audit trail from pipeline steps |
| `memory.snapshot` | ❌ | Optional export of memory core |

---

## IV. Role-Based Enforcement Policies

| Role/Class        | Enforcement Notes |
|------------------|-------------------|
| `system.core`     | Must be hardware-bound or require biometric unlock |
| `linked.trust`    | Requires signed DID (Decentralized ID) or zkProof |
| `external`        | Must be run in sandbox with outbound limits |
| `user.personal`   | Memory modules must be encrypted at rest |
| `orchestrator`    | All invocation logs must be retained for 7+ days |

---

## V. Trust Decay & Revocation

Agents may be revoked if:
- Behavioral fingerprint deviates
- Signature mismatch
- Module tampering detected
- Memory leak or escalation attempt found

Revoked agents are blacklisted in `TrustRegistry`, and alerts propagated across mesh.

---

## VI. Automation & Continuous Verification

- Use `AutoAuditBot` to re-audit agents on every update
- Random runtime spot-checks on popular or high-authority agents
- Regression behavior checks using fingerprint deltas
- Graph-based anomaly detection across agent swarm

---

## VII. Integration with kOS Governance

- Agent trust levels shown in UI
- Users can manually downgrade/disable agents
- All system-level agents subject to voting approval
- Governance layer can block agent class upgrades
