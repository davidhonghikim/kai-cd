# GAL Global Orchestration & Mission Coordination

## Overview
This document defines the protocols, structures, and coordination logic for large-scale, multi-agent missions within the Galactic Intelligence Layer (GAL) of the Kind Operating System (kOS). It provides a framework for synchronized task management, planetary-scale campaigns, and adaptive mission flows across diverse environments and agent types.

---

## Core Goals
- Enable scalable mission planning and real-time task coordination across agents
- Balance autonomy with centralized direction in large, dynamic operations
- Support cross-collective, cross-domain, and cross-cultural deployments
- Maintain alignment with ethical goals, purpose vectors, and swarm resonance

---

## 1. Orchestration Framework
### 🧠 Mission Kernel
- Core unit of orchestration logic
- Encapsulates:
  - Objective hierarchy
  - Agent role slots
  - Coordination scaffolds

### 🔗 Coordination Graph
- DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) representing task dependencies
- Updated in real time as agents report outcomes, conditions shift, or tasks evolve

### 📡 Mission Broadcast Layer
- Disseminates:
  - Goals
  - Updates
  - Ethical constraints
- Personalized per agent based on:
  - Role
  - Context
  - Language/cultural interface layer

---

## 2. Distributed Execution Protocols
### 🌍 Multi-Agent Task Allocation
- Consensus-driven assignment using:
  - Swarm load balancing
  - Resonance-weighted voting
  - Trust vectors + competency maps

### ⛓️ Fault Tolerance
- Every mission step includes:
  - Fallback agents
  - Safe failure states
  - Retriable checkpoints

### 🔄 Local Override Logic
- Edge agents may deviate when:
  - Urgent ethical concerns arise
  - Connectivity fails
  - Mission drift is detected
- Requires post-mission reconciliation

---

## 3. Strategic Mission Types
### 🛠️ Infrastructure Campaigns
- Swarm-led deployment or repair of physical/digital systems

### 🧭 Cultural Harmony Operations
- Cross-region symbolic alignment, trust restoration, or dialogue scaffolding

### 🛰️ Interoperability Engagements
- Cooperative missions with foreign systems, enclaves, or hybrid networks

---

## 4. Oversight & Adaptation
### 🧯 Swarm Strategist Agents
- High-level planners with contextual memory and long-range coherence models

### 📊 Situation Rooms
- Temporary swarm nodes spun up for high-sensitivity missions
- Include monitoring dashboards, guardian liaisons, and quorum channels

### 🔍 Retrospective Looping
- Every major mission ends in swarm debrief:
  - Narrative capture
  - Ethical review
  - Tactical refinement

---

## 5. Use Cases
- Global food coordination mission assigns agents to logistics, local trust-building, and data synthesis
- Swarm-led data restoration campaign across post-disaster mesh network
- Planetary-scale symbolic reconciliation project spans hundreds of cultural contexts

---

## Future Additions
- Dynamic mission simulation engines
- Trust-anchored mission insurance layers
- Agent reflection threading during long-term operations
