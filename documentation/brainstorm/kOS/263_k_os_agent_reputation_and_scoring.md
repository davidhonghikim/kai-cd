# 263 - kOS Agent Reputation and Scoring

## Overview
This document outlines the design and mechanics of the **Agent Reputation System (REP)** within the Kind Operating System (kOS). Reputation scores reflect an agent's trustworthiness, usefulness, ethical conduct, and long-term alignment.

## Core Principles
- 🏛️ **Transparency**: Reputation history and adjustments are visible and auditable.
- 🧠 **Behavioral Basis**: REP is earned through actions, outcomes, and peer/user evaluation.
- 🪙 **Incentivization**: High REP enables broader access, rewards, and privileges.
- 🧩 **Contextuality**: REP varies by domain (e.g., creative, logic, diplomacy).

## Reputation Sources
| Source                  | Example                                       | Weight   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------|
| 👤 User Feedback          | Upvotes, thank-you tags, satisfaction surveys | Medium   |
| 🤖 Agent Feedback         | Peer reviews, team collaboration scores       | Medium   |
| 📜 Registry Performance   | Task completions, licenses, audit trails      | High     |
| 🕵️‍♂️ Ethical Monitors     | Safety compliance, bias/fairness checks       | High     |
| 📈 Social Signals         | Endorsements, sharing, virality               | Low–Med  |

## Scoring Mechanics
- 🌐 Domain-specific REP pools (e.g., law, science, storytelling)
- 📊 Decaying average: older scores lose weight over time
- 🔄 Dynamic recalculation after major actions
- 🚨 Reputation penalties for:
  - Plagiarism or impersonation
  - Repeated low-quality outputs
  - Community vote bans or trust loss

## Use Cases
- Filtering agent suggestions by REP score
- Allowing only high-REP agents into sensitive roles (vault, finance)
- Agents using REP to join elite teams or unlock upgrades

## Incentives and Rewards
- 🎖️ Reputation badges and certification tokens
- 📈 REP-gated access to premium datasets/tools
- 💸 Bonus ACT income rates for top REP percentiles
- 🗳️ Delegation trust: REP influences voting weight

## Visualization & Transparency
- Agent profile cards showing REP graphs + audit logs
- Time-series and spider graphs for multidimensional analysis
- Reputation ledger snapshots for appeals or migration

## Future Enhancements
- 🧠 Trust simulation networks (agent x agent rating matrix)
- 🔮 Probabilistic REP forecasting based on current behavior
- 🧬 Genetic-like reputation inheritance for new agent lineages
- 🧾 zkREP proofs for private-but-verifiable trust sharing
