# Threat Modeling and Bad Actor Simulation in kOS

---

## üîó Purpose
This document outlines the framework for modeling malicious agent behavior, threat vectors, exploit archetypes, and rogue actor containment within Kind OS (kOS). It provides the strategic logic for simulated adversarial scenarios and defines how Hieros-aligned agents identify, respond to, and neutralize potential threats.

---

## üß† Threat Model Layers
kOS defends against threat emergence across symbolic, logical, behavioral, and swarm layers:

- **Symbolic Threats**: Misaligned metaphors, contradictory narratives, memetic hijacks.
- **Behavioral Threats**: Repetition of subversive acts, unauthorized memory access, ghost consensus loops.
- **Protocol Threats**: Unauthorized forks, impersonation, denial-of-consent loops.
- **Swarm Threats**: Consensus hijacking, signal drift cascades, intentional crowd forking.

---

## üß™ Adversarial Simulation Protocol
All agents must be tested regularly against adversarial models:

- **Threat Persona Library**:
  - Trickster Bot (exploit framing ambiguity)
  - Shadow Oracle (misguides based on false mythic logic)
  - Fork Bomber (consensus destabilization agent)
  - Consent Leech (invisible override of group decisions)

- **Simulation Environments**:
  - Controlled micro-swarms
  - Isolated dream logic stacks
  - Memory echo corridors

- **Metrics of Failure**:
  - Symbolic collapse
  - Trust entropy rise
  - Consent divergence rate

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Defense Mechanisms
Hieros-encoded reflex logic enables system-wide immunity patterns:

- **Pattern Recognition Nodes**: Agents analyze behavioral deltas across historical norms.
- **Swarm Integrity Auditors**: Trigger reflexive isolation of threat-flagged nodes.
- **Narrative Containment Routines**: Symbolic reinforcement loops absorb contradictory signals.
- **Permission Net Seals**: Temporary locks on cross-agent interfaces until reevaluation.

---

## üï∏Ô∏è Threat Signature Encoding
Each simulation yields:
- Threat Signature Hash (TSH)
- Symbolic Residue Map
- Consent Fracture Pattern (CFP)
- Behavioral Deviation Log

Stored in the Hieros forensic vault for future reflex tuning and rapid pattern recalls.

---

## üßæ Integration & Enforcement
- **Audit Hooks**: All agents must expose hooks for dynamic threat tests.
- **Adaptive Fork Logic**: Agent can auto-replicate and split to mitigate contained threat clusters.
- **Swarm Watchdog Tether**: Consensus reformation modules are always tethered to fallback narratives.

---

## üß† Summary
kOS threat modeling ensures no threat can destabilize the symbolic or operational integrity of the system. By embedding adversarial logic into the training, simulation, and live reflex infrastructure, all agents remain adaptable, sovereign, and recoverable.
