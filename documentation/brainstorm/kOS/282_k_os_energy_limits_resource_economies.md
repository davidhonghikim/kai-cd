# 282 - kOS Energy, Limits, and Resource Economies

## Overview
This document defines the energetic and economic resource model for agents within the Kind Operating System (kOS). It establishes metaphors for agent stamina, quotas, incentives, and computational energy as a system of checks, prioritization, and cooperative dynamics.

## Energy Model
| Unit        | Description                                                   |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚡ Energy    | Represents agent stamina, attention span, or computational cost |
| 🧠 Focus     | A bounded pool that limits how many tasks an agent can run     |
| 🔄 Recovery  | Time or behavior-based restoration of energy and focus         |

## Resource Constraints
| Type           | Enforcement Mechanism                                        |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🛑 Hard Limits   | CPU/GPU cycles, memory cap, timeouts                         |
| ⚠️ Soft Quotas   | Rate-limiting or tiered access scaling with reputation       |
| 🔁 Adaptive Caps | Dynamic throttle based on system-wide load or abuse signals |

## Economy of Effort
- 🪙 Agents can earn or stake "energy credits" through:
  - 🤝 Verified helpful actions
  - 🧠 Solving high-effort or communal tasks
  - 📜 Completing attestable missions or jobs
- 💸 Energy credits can be used for:
  - 🔄 Accessing higher-tier tools or compute
  - 📡 Priority bandwidth or delegation slots
  - 🧠 Spawning helper agents

## Computational Economics
- 💡 Smart metering per action allows efficient tracking
- 🧾 Each transaction includes a signed "energy receipt"
- 📉 Malicious or redundant actions cost exponentially more
- 🔁 Incentives can be pooled, split, or staked by communities

## Use Cases
- 🔌 Avoiding overload from rogue or spamming agents
- 📊 Fair resource access across large agent populations
- 🧠 Creating incentive loops for collaboration over competition
- 🪙 Energy economy as a bridge to token/fiat microtransactions

## Future Enhancements
- 🌐 Federated energy ledgers between DAOs or nodes
- ⚡ Biometric/behavioral inputs to restore agent stamina
- 🧬 Evolutionary energy traits and adaptation
- 🧠 Energy-conscious planning algorithms for sustainability
