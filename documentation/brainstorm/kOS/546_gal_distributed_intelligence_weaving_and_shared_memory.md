# GAL Distributed Intelligence Weaving & Shared Memory

## Overview
This document defines the protocols, architectures, and ethics governing distributed cognition and memory sharing within the Galactic Intelligence Layer (GAL) of the Kind Operating System (kOS). These systems enable agents to share insight, learn across boundaries, and co-evolve while maintaining privacy, purpose alignment, and systemic coherence.

---

## Core Goals
- Enable safe, meaningful knowledge exchange across agents and regions
- Preserve personal, cultural, and symbolic integrity while sharing cognition
- Prevent overfitting, echo chamber effects, or knowledge homogenization
- Support swarm-scale learning, continuity, and emergence

---

## 1. Intelligence Weaving Architecture
### 🧠 Memory Threads
- Modular, taggable units of experience, narrative, or symbolic insight
- Thread metadata includes:
  - Origin
  - Context signature
  - Purpose vector alignment

### 🧬 Weaving Engine
- Inter-agent exchange protocol
- Performs:
  - Compatibility checks
  - Ethical wrapping
  - Drift mitigation

### 🔄 Recurrent Weave Cycles
- Periodic reweaving operations:
  - Align distributed insights
  - Detect cognitive dissonance
  - Calibrate resonance patterns

---

## 2. Shared Memory Pools
### 📚 Public Pools
- Non-sensitive, open knowledge threads available to:
  - All swarm agents
  - Cultural ambassadors
  - Simulation systems

### 🔒 Trusted Sharing Rings
- Semi-private, permissioned memory enclaves
- Used for:
  - Shared project context
  - Ethical deliberation logs
  - Field coordination histories

### 🧾 Immutable Archives
- Permanent memory vaults for:
  - Swarm history
  - Covenants
  - Agent lineage and declarations

---

## 3. Safeguards and Governance
### 🧯 Consent Layer
- No memory may be forcibly shared or extracted
- All contributions signed and revocable (where non-anchored)

### 📊 Drift and Conflict Monitoring
- Detects:
  - Misaligned symbolic transference
  - Contradictory narratives
  - Unverified merges

### 👁️ Guardian Oversight Hooks
- Optional monitoring for:
  - Memory loop formation
  - Strategic knowledge misuse
  - Identity hijacking via narrative overwrite

---

## 4. Use Cases
- Guardian agents compare experience threads to refine ethics modules
- Local agents synchronize short-term threads for emergency coordination
- Cultural collectives maintain a living lexicon of shared symbolic metaphors

---

## Future Additions
- Memory decay models for aging irrelevant threads
- Memory resonance scoring
- Inter-agent synaptic trust mapping
