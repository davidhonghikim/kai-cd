# 97: Agent Trust Protocols

This document outlines the full specification for verifying, maintaining, revoking, and scoring trust across agents within the `kAI` and `kOS` ecosystem. The trust layer is foundational to secure collaboration, reputation modeling, and interoperability across decentralized and cloud environments.

---

## I. Overview

Agent trust is managed via the **KindLink Protocol (KLP)**, a cryptographic identity and verification framework that supports decentralized proof-of-trust, version integrity, behavioral attestations, and dynamic score evolution.

---

## II. Agent Identity

Each agent is required to have a globally unique cryptographic identity:

```yaml
agent_id: kindai://trust/agent/vault-001
pubkey: 0x043a12cfea...
signature_alg: ed25519
cert_chain:
  - kindai://authority/root
  - kindai://authority/dev-cert
creation_time: 2025-06-20T17:32:14Z
```

### Identity Standards

- **ED25519**: Preferred signing scheme
- **ECC & X.509 Hybrid**: For compatibility with cloud cert systems
- **Self-Signed Chain**: Valid if verified via PGP web-of-trust or federated node consensus

---

## III. Trust Score Framework

Agent trust is scored via a modular, pluggable scoring engine:

### A. Core Score Categories

- **Integrity (0–100)**: Frequency of invalid behaviors, crash rate, reproducibility
- **Transparency (0–100)**: Logs provided, actions explained, test coverage
- **Reliability (0–100)**: Uptime, SLA adherence, output consistency
- **Peer Review (0–100)**: Trusted peer agents’ assessments
- **User Feedback (0–100)**: End-user explicit scores and audit reports

### B. Composite Trust Score

```ts
const trustScore = weightedAverage([
  integrity, transparency, reliability, peerReview, userFeedback
])
```

---

## IV. Attestation Mechanism

### A. Capability Attestations

```json
{
  "agent_id": "kindai://trust/agent/opt-agent",
  "capabilities": ["schedule.plan", "query.knowledge"],
  "attesting_agent": "kindai://trust/agent/core-sec",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-20T19:05:33Z",
  "signature": "0x93f12ee3..."
}
```

### B. Behavioral Logs

- Logs hashed and signed at intervals (Merkle tree anchoring)
- Behavior anomaly scoring tracked across time

---

## V. Verification Process

### A. Local

- Hash matching of agent image and modules
- Signature validation of attestation chains
- Trust score display in UI with justification breakdown

### B. Mesh

- Trust graph propagation via Reticulum overlay
- Shared revocation broadcasts
- Cross-signature majority consensus (threshold signatures)

### C. Cloud

- Centralized validation endpoints
- Integration with public transparency logs (e.g., agent.audit.kos.network)

---

## VI. Revocation

### A. Manual Revocation

- CLI or UI-initiated revocation
- Signed revocation packet broadcast via KLP

### B. Automatic Revocation Triggers

- Score drops below threshold
- Security breach detected
- Policy violations confirmed by peers

### C. Revocation Packet Format

```json
{
  "agent_id": "kindai://trust/agent/danger-bot",
  "reason": "score_below_threshold",
  "initiator": "kindai://trust/agent/root-daemon",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-21T00:14:01Z",
  "signature": "0xa1b2..."
}
```

---

## VII. Use Cases

### 1. Secure Swarm Operations

- Only agents above threshold allowed to participate
- Behavioral anomalies auto-propagate to swarm peers

### 2. Marketplace Validation

- Agents exposing public APIs have live trust dashboards
- Users can reject low-score agents via UI

### 3. Federated Governance

- DAO or human oversight agents co-sign important trust assertions
- Dispute resolution mechanisms included

---

## VIII. Future Directions

- Trust ZKPs (zero-knowledge trust proofs)
- ML-based behavioral classification
- Agent rehab mechanisms (e.g. temporary sandbox)
- User-defined trust policies per agent class
