# 63: Adaptive Learning Modules – Personalized Knowledge Expansion for kAI

This document outlines the structure, logic, and deployment strategy of Adaptive Learning Modules (ALMs) within the Kind AI (kAI) ecosystem. ALMs enable dynamic, evolving intelligence through progressive training, modular plug-ins, and user-directed growth.

---

## I. Purpose

Adaptive Learning Modules allow:

- Personalized user-directed training
- In-context skill/module upgrades
- Layered agent specialization (e.g., science tutor, legal expert)
- Offline knowledge loading and auditability

---

## II. Directory Structure

            └── postModuleFeedback.ts       # Accepts user scoring and notes
```

## III. Module Structure

Each ALM is a versioned Markdown or JSON-based file with the following structure:

```yaml
id: 201_interaction_protocols
version: 1.2.0
category: communication
prerequisites: ['101_foundations_kai']
difficulty: intermediate
skills:
  - name: Identify Intent Types
    description: Understand user request types by category
    test_prompt: What kind of request is "Remind me to walk at 5pm"?
    expected_output: intent.reminder.create
  - name: Generate Clarifying Questions
    description: Prompt user for missing information
    test_prompt: "Book me a flight"
    expected_output: What is your destination and date of travel?
```

Modules can be:

- **Pre-installed** with the base system
- **User-created** and signed
- **Third-party distributed** via Kind Package (KPK) bundles

## IV. Learning Cycle

### A. User Initialization

1. User selects or is assigned an ALM
2. `ModuleLoader` validates, registers with `SkillRegistry`
3. If prerequisites unmet, user is prompted to queue those modules

### B. Training Phase

1. Prompts from module are injected into task context
2. Agent generates responses
3. Auto or user review of output vs. expectations
4. Feedback loop updates skill confidence score

### C. Completion

- Skill tagged as "trained"
- Audit log entry written
- Optional: badge added to agent profile

---

## V. User Controls

- ✅ Approve/deny module usage
- 📚 View learning logs
- ⚙️ Adjust difficulty or verbosity
- 🧠 Request retraining
- ✍️ Submit new ALMs

---

## VI. Feedback and Rating

Each module interaction may:

- Prompt user for 1–5 star rating
- Accept freeform comments
- Store data as:

```json
{
  "module_id": "201_interaction_protocols",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-20T14:44:00Z",
  "rating": 4,
  "notes": "Good but needed more examples."
}
```

---

## VII. Privacy and Storage

- Modules are local by default
- Progress logs stored encrypted in `~/.kai/learning_logs/`
- Cloud sync optional and user-controlled

---

## VIII. Future Enhancements

| Feature                       | ETA  |
| ----------------------------- | ---- |
| Vector-aware learning modules | v1.3 |
| Langchain agent integration   | v1.4 |
| Module marketplace (signed)   | v1.5 |
| Git-based module federation   | v1.6 |
