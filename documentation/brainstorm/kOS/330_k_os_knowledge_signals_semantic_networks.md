# 330 - kOS Knowledge, Signals, and Semantic Networks

## Overview
This document defines how knowledge is represented, transferred, inferred, and related within the Kind Operating System (kOS). Semantic networks, signals, and knowledge graphs form the informational scaffolding that allows agents to reason, communicate, adapt, and evolve.

## Core Concepts
| Element            | Description                                                                         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Knowledge Graphs  | Structured, queryable networks of linked facts, beliefs, and assertions             |
| 📡 Signal Channels   | Streams of real-time or ambient data that affect agent decisions or awareness      |
| 🌐 Semantic Webs     | Federated ontologies and relationships for interpreting meaning and context        |
| 🔍 Traceable Claims  | Verified and source-attributed knowledge fragments with reputation-weighted trust |

## Knowledge Types
- 📘 Declarative: Facts, definitions, rules
- 🧠 Procedural: How-tos, workflows, techniques
- 🤔 Heuristic: Best guesses, approximations, subjective evaluations
- 🧬 Experiential: Memory-based learning, logs, simulations

## Signal Categories
- 🛰️ Sensor Data: Real-world input from connected systems
- 💬 Social Signals: Agent chatter, endorsements, feedback loops
- 🔁 System Metrics: Performance, usage, anomalies
- 📈 Environmental Trends: Behavioral drift, macro-patterns, swarm signals

## Semantic Structure
- 🧩 Ontology Packs: Modular concept frameworks defining term relationships
- 🧠 Cross-domain Linkers: Connect ideas from disparate fields for transfer learning
- 🔎 Meta-Reasoners: Reflective agents that monitor and refine semantic coherence
- 📎 Context Weights: Prioritize facts and interpretations by situation relevance

## Learning Models
- 🤖 Federated Updates: Shared learnings synced between agents without central server
- 🧪 Epistemic Testing: Model beliefs against alternate facts or simulations
- 🎓 Mentor Linking: Transfer higher-rep agent knowledge to newcomers
- 🔄 Lifecycle Learning: Update beliefs through aging, decay, and reinforcement

## Access and Navigation
- 🔍 Visual Graph Interfaces: Explore webs of meaning, contribution, and trust
- 📚 Query Languages: DSLs for interrogating agent and network knowledge
- 🧠 Conversational Recall: Agent summaries or storytelling from knowledge contexts
- 🛰️ Signal-Aware Agents: Real-time behavior tuning based on live data streams
