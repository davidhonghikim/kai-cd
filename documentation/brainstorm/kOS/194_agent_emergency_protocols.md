# 194: Agent Emergency Interruption Protocols

## Overview
This document outlines the mandatory emergency handling, fail-safe responses, and critical escalation procedures for all agents in the kAI/kOS ecosystem. It ensures that when high-risk, unknown, or potentially damaging operations are detected, agents act with precision, safety, and transparency, following strict procedures for human override, rollback, and recovery.

---

## üî• Emergency Classification

### Class 1: Agent Halt Required
- **Description**: Detected unrecoverable error, data corruption, security breach, or contradiction to core rules.
- **Response**: Immediate halt of the agent's task execution and services.
- **Examples**:
  - Unauthorized mutation of a critical config.
  - Looping infinite deployment tasks.
  - Detection of tampered execution logs.

### Class 2: Escalation with Continued Operation
- **Description**: High-risk behavior detected, but execution can continue with caution.
- **Response**: Marked for review, safe-state fallback, execution trace saved.
- **Examples**:
  - Model output suggesting self-modification.
  - Unexpected deletion of non-user-owned files.

### Class 3: Non-Critical Anomalies
- **Description**: Low-risk anomalies, but worth alerting the system or user.
- **Response**: Report to monitoring/logs, store debug trace.
- **Examples**:
  - Misaligned prompt/context memory.
  - Unexpected rate-limiting of external API.

## üö® Detection Protocols

### Self-Monitoring Systems
- Agents are required to monitor their own logs, memory, input/output consistency.
- Key detection triggers:
  - Command execution anomaly
  - Context drift exceeding 5 hops
  - External call with no rate limit headers
  - Overwrite of locked system file

### Watchdog Agent
- Independent low-resource watchdog process per agent instance.
- Cross-checks memory patterns, action stack, unauthorized state transitions.
- Can terminate main agent container on Class 1 detection.

### System Integrity Daemon (SID)
- Runs at the OS/container level.
- Validates:
  - Hash checks of core modules
  - Timestamps of agent file writes
  - Signs of unauthorized lateral movement

---

## üõë Interrupt & Quarantine Protocol

### 1. Immediate Interrupt
- Agent sends `INTERRUPT()` command to its orchestration controller.
- Execution stack is dumped to:
  - `/var/kind/interrupts/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`
  - Cloud sync if enabled (e.g. to KindHub or KindVault)

### 2. Quarantine State Activation
- All write operations halted.
- Read-only mode enforced.
- Service access revoked temporarily (except audit interfaces).

### 3. Alert Dispatch
- Webhook POST to all registered receivers
- Email + optional push notification
- PGP-signed log summary attached

---

## üßØ Recovery Process

### Human Override
- Admin user must confirm override via:
  - Signed request via CLI or KindPanel
  - Recovery key (Yubikey, FIDO2, mnemonic phrase, etc.)

### Rollback Options
- Restore from:
  - Last auto-snapshot
  - Manual checkpoint
  - Git-based change timeline if enabled

### Audit Trail Requirements
- Every emergency event triggers:
  - `interrupt_event.log`
  - Hash-verified dump of:
    - Agent state
    - Prompt stack
    - Memory embeddings
    - Active config set
  - SHA256 + timestamp signing

---

## üîê Security Considerations

- Interrupt logs never include raw credential dumps.
- All dumps are encrypted (AES-256-GCM) if encryption is enabled.
- Rollback versions are read-only until verified.

## üß† Agent Behavior During Interruption

| State | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Normal Execution | Run as usual |
| Class 2 Flag | Drop into semi-passive mode, require user confirmation to escalate |
| Quarantine Mode | Disable write, disable LLM calls, enter memory lock |
| Recovery Mode | Only respond to human commands or override chain |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Developer Testing Checklist

| üîò | Task |
|----|------|
| ‚¨ú | Simulate Class 1 interrupt from file overwrite |
| ‚¨ú | Validate watchdog auto-kill trigger |
| ‚¨ú | Confirm snapshot rollback works |
| ‚¨ú | Confirm interrupt alert log encryption |
| ‚¨ú | Review System Integrity Daemon alerts under simulated tampering |

---

## üìé Notes
- These protocols are required in all production agents.
- Test environments must be able to simulate all 3 emergency classes.
- No agent is allowed to bypass these protocols, even in debug mode.
