# Memory Architecture

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: This document describes the memory architecture for Kai-CD and future kOS systems. Use this to understand how agents store, retrieve, and manage memory across different time scales and contexts.

## Overview

The memory architecture provides a multi-tiered system for storing and retrieving information across different time scales and contexts. The system is designed to support both current Kai-CD functionality and future kOS agent mesh capabilities.
