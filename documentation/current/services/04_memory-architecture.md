# Memory Architecture

> **Agent Context**: Multi-tiered memory system for agent storage and retrieval  
> **Implementation**: ðŸ”„ Partial - Chrome storage working, vector database planned  
> **Use When**: Understanding memory patterns, implementing storage, planning agent memory

## Quick Summary
Multi-tiered memory architecture providing storage and retrieval across different time scales and contexts, supporting current Kai-CD functionality and future kOS agent mesh capabilities.

## Overview

The memory architecture provides a multi-tiered system for storing and retrieving information across different time scales and contexts. The system is designed to support both current Kai-CD functionality and future kOS agent mesh capabilities.
