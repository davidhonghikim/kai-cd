**Title:** Backup and Maintenance

**Backups:**

*   **User-Initiated Backups:** Provide a UI button to trigger a backup. The backup should include:
    *   The extension's configuration file.
    *   Any stored artifacts (images, chat logs).
*   **Automated Backups:** Implement a setting to enable periodic backups (e.g., daily, weekly).
*   **Remote Backups:** Integrate SSH, rsync, or SFTP to allow users to store backups on remote servers.

**Maintenance:**

*   **Extension Updates:** Check for updates automatically and prompt the user to install them.
*   **Dependency Updates:** Keep the extension's dependencies up-to-date.
*   **Monitoring:** Monitor extension logs for errors and performance issues.
*   **Error Reporting:** Implement a system for automatically reporting errors to developers.
