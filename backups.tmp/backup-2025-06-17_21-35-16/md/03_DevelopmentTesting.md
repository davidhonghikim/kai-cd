**Title:** Development and Testing

**Setup:**

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Configure environment variables (if needed).
4.  Start the development server: `npm run dev` (or equivalent for your build tool).

**Workflow:**

*   Use feature branches: `git checkout -b feature/<feature_name>`
*   Adhere to coding standards (see 12_BestPractices.md).
*   Write comprehensive tests.
*   Submit pull requests against the `develop` branch.
*   Participate in code reviews.

**Coding Standards:**

*   Follow established JavaScript/HTML/CSS/React best practices.
*   Use TypeScript for type safety.
*   Write clear, concise, and well-commented code.
*   Use ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting.

**Debugging:**

*   Use Chrome DevTools for debugging JavaScript and inspecting network traffic.
*   Utilize console logging for debugging background scripts.
*   Set breakpoints and step through code to identify issues.

**Deployment:**

1.  Build the extension for production: `npm run build`
2.  Load the unpacked extension in Chrome/Edge (developer mode).
3.  Test thoroughly.
4.  Submit the extension to the Chrome/Edge Web Store.

**Testing:**

*   **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions and modules in isolation.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between different components (e.g., background script and service connectors).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Test the complete user flow from the UI to the remote AI services.
*   **Testing Tools:**
    *   Jest or Mocha: For unit and integration tests.
    *   Playwright or Selenium: For E2E tests.
*   **Test Coverage:** Strive for high code coverage (80% or greater).
*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automate testing on pull requests using a CI platform (e.g., GitHub Actions).
