# ChatDemon Project Overview and Goals
**Title:** Project Overview and Goals

**Overview:** This document outlines the vision, goals, and key features of the ChatDemon project.

**Vision:** ChatDemon is a browser extension that streamlines the management and integration of AI services, enabling efficient cross-model communication and artifact management within a unified environment.

**Problem:** AI workflows are fragmented. Users juggle multiple interfaces for LLMs, image generators, automation tools, and vector databases. This leads to inefficiency and difficulty in orchestrating complex AI-driven tasks.

**Target Users:** AI developers, researchers, and power users who manage local or remote AI services. Also, teams seeking to leverage interconnected AI tooling for collab work.

**Value Proposition:**

*   **Unified Interface:** Consolidate AI management into a single browser extension.
*   **Direct UI Integration:** Seamlessly incorporate existing UIs from services like OpenWebUI, ComfyUI, and A1111 through iframes.
*   **Model Bridging:** Facilitate communication and data transfer between different AI services (LLMs to Image Gen, etc.).
*   **Artifact Management:** Store, search, and manage AI-generated outputs (images, chat logs).
*   **Remote Server Management:** Simplify the management of AI services running on remote servers (backups, file management).
*   **Configuration Flexibility:** Import/export service configurations, making setup and sharing easy.

**Key Features:**

1.  **Service Management:** Add, edit, and remove AI service connections.
2.  **Side Panel Chat:** Lightweight chat interface for quick LLM interactions.
3.  **Full UI Tabs:** Display remote service UIs (OpenWebUI, ComfyUI, A1111) in dedicated tabs. This utilizes iframes to embed the existing interfaces.
4.  **Model Bridging:** Enable communication between different AI services.
5.  **Artifact Storage and Search:** Store generated images, chat logs, and other AI artifacts. Implement a search interface with metadata support.
6.  **Remote Server Management:** Integrate SSH, rsync, and SFTP for managing remote AI servers.
7.  **Configuration Import/Export:** Allow users to save and load extension settings from files.

**Detailed Functionality (Important for Coding Agent):**

*   **Side Panel Chat:**
    *   Allow selection of a connected LLM service and model.
    *   Provide a simple text input area for prompts.
    *   Display LLM responses in a chat-like format.
    *   Include basic chat controls (clear chat, copy response).
*   **Full-Function Tabs (Iframe Integration):**
    *   Each tab hosts the UI of a connected service directly within an `<iframe>`.
    *   The extension needs to ensure proper iframe communication and security.
*   **Model Bridging:**
    *   Establish clear mechanisms for passing prompts and data between the side panel chat (LLM) and the full-function tabs (e.g., image generation services).
    *   Use service APIs (documented in the Service Integration Guides) to trigger actions on remote servers.
    *   Implement data transformations as needed to ensure compatibility between services.
*   **Artifact Storage and Search:**
    *   Store artifacts (images, chat logs) locally or on a user-specified storage location.
    *   Metadata should include: Service, Model, Prompt, Timestamp, and other relevant information.
    *   Implement a search interface to filter and find artifacts.
*   **Remote Server Management (SSH/rsync/SFTP):**
    *   Provide a UI to configure remote server connections (hostname, port, username, password/key).
    *   Integrate SSH, rsync, and SFTP libraries to perform actions on the remote server (backup directories, transfer files).
    *   Implement security measures to protect user credentials.
*   **Configuration Import/Export:**
    *   Store extension settings in a JSON or YAML file.
    *   Provide UI controls to export and import this file.

**Success Metrics:** User adoption, service integration coverage, performance, user satisfaction, community contributions.

**Concerns:** Security (API key management, remote server access), Performance (Iframe overhead, data transfer), User Experience (ease of configuration, intuitive workflows).

**Roadmap (Example):**
*   Phase 1: Core connections (OpenWebUI, A1111, ComfyUI), basic side panel chat, iframe integration.
*   Phase 2: Model bridging (LLM to Image Gen), configuration import/export.
*   Phase 3: SSH/rsync/SFTP integration, basic artifact storage.
*   Phase 4: Advanced artifact searching, remote server monitoring.
