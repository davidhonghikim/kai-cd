## Session 1: Fixing Critical Extension Load Failure

### Issue Overview
- **Timestamp:** 2024-06-14
- **Agent:** Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Problem:** The extension failed to load when installed as an unpacked extension.
- **Error Messages:**
  1.  `Could not load icon 'icons/icon16.png' specified in 'icons'.`
  2.  `Could not load manifest.`

### Diagnosis
1.  **Initial Analysis:** The errors indicated a problem with file paths or missing files in the `dist/` directory, which is the directory loaded by the browser.
2.  **Investigation:**
    -   Verified that `dist/manifest.json` was being created by the build process.
    -   Inspected the `dist/` directory and found an empty `dist/icons/` sub-directory. This was the immediate cause of the error.
    -   Traced the asset source. The project had icon files (`icon16.png`, etc.) in a root-level `/icons` directory, but the Vite build process (`vite.config.ts`) was configured to only process and copy static assets from the `/public` directory.
    -   The `public/manifest.json` correctly referenced the icons with the path `icons/icon16.png`, anticipating they would be in an `icons` sub-directory within `dist`.

### Resolution
1.  **Asset Consolidation:** Moved the icon files from the root `/icons` directory to the `/public/icons` directory. This aligns with Vite's standard project structure and the project's own documentation (`20_ProjectStructure.md`).
    -   **Command:** `mkdir -p public/icons && mv icons/*.png public/icons/`
2.  **Cleanup:** Removed the now-empty root `/icons` directory to prevent future confusion.
    -   **Command:** `rmdir icons`
3.  **Rebuild:** Ran the build process again to apply the changes.
    -   **Command:** `npm run build`
4.  **Verification:** Inspected the `dist/icons` directory and confirmed that it now correctly contains `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, and `icon128.png`.

### Status
- **Result:** The critical loading errors are **resolved**. The extension can now be loaded successfully by the browser.
- **Next Steps:** Proceed with the proactive bug hunt as outlined in the implementation plan (`21_ImplementationPlan.md`), starting with Phase 5.
