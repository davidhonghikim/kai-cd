# üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and development priorities for Kai-CD. It serves as a task list for developers and AI agents.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Services (‚úÖ Complete)

The primary focus of this phase was to build a robust foundation for the application and implement support for the most common and essential AI services.

### Priority 1: Complete Core Documentation Suite
Status: ‚úÖ Complete
Task: Finish generating all documentation files as outlined in `00_Index.md`.

### Priority 2: Flesh out All Service Definitions
Status: ‚úÖ Complete
Description: All placeholder service definition files have been fleshed out with their core capabilities, endpoints, and parameter schemas based on their respective API documentation.

### Priority 3: Develop the Core User Interface
Status: ‚úÖ Complete
Description: The dynamic user interface has been implemented. A Zustand store manages service state, and the UI dynamically generates forms and chat interfaces based on the capabilities defined in each service.
Key Implementations:
- `useServiceStore` created for state management.
- `ServiceSelector` connected to the store.
- `CapabilityUI` dynamically renders views for `LlmChatCapability` and `ImageGenerationCapability`.
- `ParameterControl` component created to render form elements dynamically.
- `apiClient` implemented for frontend to backend communication.

## Phase 2: Advanced Features & Usability (üéØ Current Focus)

### Priority 1: Chat & History
Status: ‚úÖ Complete
Description: Enhance the `LlmChatView` to persist conversation history.
Next Steps:
- Modify `useServiceStore` to store message history for each service.
- Update `LlmChatView` to load and save messages to the store.
- Consider adding timestamps and the ability to clear history.

### Priority 2: Image Gallery
Status: ‚úÖ Complete
Description: Create a gallery to view and manage images generated by services.
Next Steps:
- Create a new `ImageGalleryView` component.
- Modify `ImageGenerationView` to save generated images (e.g., the base64 data) to a new store or to the existing `useServiceStore`.
- Implement features to view, download, and delete images from the gallery.

### Priority 3: Settings Management
Status: ‚úÖ Complete
Description: Build a comprehensive settings page.
Next Steps:
- Create a new settings page, likely in a new tab.
- Allow users to add, edit, and remove services from the `useServiceStore`.
- Implement UI for managing API keys and other global application settings from `src/config/env.ts`.

### Side Panel Integration
Status: ‚úÖ Complete
Description: Develop a useful side-panel experience, perhaps for quick access to a specific service while browsing.

## Phase 3: Extensibility & Polish

### Priority 1: Improved Error Handling
Status: ‚úÖ Complete
Description: The application now provides clear, user-friendly error messages from service APIs using a toast notification system.

### Priority 2: Custom Workflows
Status: ‚ö™ Not Started
Description: Explore ways to chain different services together (e.g., use an LLM to generate a prompt for an image model).

### Priority 3: Full Test Coverage
Status: ‚ö™ Not Started
Description: Implement the testing strategy outlined in `04_DevelopmentTesting.md`.
