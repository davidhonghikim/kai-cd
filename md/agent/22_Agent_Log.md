## Task: Critical Bug Fixes & Project Stabilization

### Summary
This session was dedicated to resolving a series of critical, cascading bugs that had left the application in a non-functional state. The primary focus was on dependency management, build system repair, and fixing the resulting UI failures.

### Diagnosis & Resolution

1.  **`Uncaught TypeError: this.getData is not a function`**
    *   **Diagnosis**: This critical error was breaking all React-based UI. The `grep` search found no instances of `getData`, pointing to a dependency issue. Analysis of `package.json` revealed a version mismatch between `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm`, compounded by `react-beautiful-dnd` being incompatible with React 19.
    *   **Resolution**:
        1.  Upgraded `remark-gfm` from `^3.0.1` to `^4.0.0` for better compatibility.
        2.  Identified that `react-beautiful-dnd` was blocking `npm install` due to its React 18 peer dependency.
        3.  Removed `react-beautiful-dnd` and its types from `package.json`.
        4.  Removed the usage of the drag-and-drop library from `ServiceManagement.tsx` to fix the subsequent build failure.

2.  **`DocsViewer` Not Rendering Content**
    *   **Diagnosis**: The viewer was blank because my assumption about the structure of the `docModules` object from Vite's `import.meta.glob` was incorrect. I was trying to access the content directly, when it was nested under a `default` property.
    *   **Resolution**:
        1.  Added extensive logging to `DocsViewer.tsx` to inspect the live `docModules` object.
        2.  The logs confirmed the structure was `{ '/path/to/doc.md': { default: '...' } }`.
        3.  Modified the component to correctly access `module.default` to retrieve the content.

3.  **Broken UI Navigation (Popup & Docs)**
    *   **Diagnosis**: The popup buttons and internal doc links were failing. This was a symptom of the root `getData` error breaking React's event handling, combined with an async issue in the popup.
    *   **Resolution**:
        1.  Fixing the core dependency issue resolved the event system, allowing `e.preventDefault()` to work again in the `DocsViewer`'s `LinkRenderer`.
        2.  Modified the `onClick` handlers in `Popup.tsx` to be `async` and to `await` the `switchToTab`/`switchToPanel` functions, preventing `window.close()` from executing prematurely.

### Final State
The application is now in a stable, buildable state. The critical errors have been resolved, and the UI is functional, though some features (like drag-and-drop) have been temporarily disabled and styling needs improvement. The codebase is now prepared for handoff.

### Addendum: History Cleanup
*Per user request, the previous messy commit history (which included a failed build and a force-pushed amendment) was reset. All changes from this session were consolidated into a single, clean commit.*
